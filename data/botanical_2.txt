to grow plant we should perceive it in relation to 
position in the vegetation system it informs us on the 
of development in the long history of life on Earth 
we should be aware of its demands on the environment 
requirements the degree of adaptability to changes in the environment 
or resistance to insect fungal and other pathogens We should 
informed about the natural extension of this taxon on Earth 
it is native species or naturalized with us or newly 
species with which we lack experience and also the origin 
its direct ancestors whether they are individuals originating from seed 
or grafts Simply put you need to understand each plant 
in time and space and what is more as these 
living organisms we should take into consideration their life experience 
reactions absolute and relative age ontogeny stage and their growth 
and changes in shape Life domains and phylogeny of tree 
on Earth Life on Earth is composed of unicellular and 
cellular living systems organisms capable of performing all life functions 
information flow Cellular systems originate in one hypothetically assumed ancestor 
progenot which evolved in two evolutionary lines about billion years 
One directed to the bacteria Prokaryote domain and the second 
the Eukaryote domain Prokaryote Bacteria and archaea domains are unicellular 
of prokaryotic type Their cells contain cytoplasm plasma membrane and 
Nucleoid is not divided from the cytoplasm by membrane it 
composed of one generally circular double stranded piece of deoxyribonucleic 
DNA The interior of these cells is not divided by 
of membranes mitochondria and plastids are missing Prokaryotic organisms are 
of heterotrophic nutrition as saprophytes and parasites growing both in 
aerobic or anaerobic environment as well as autotrophic nutrition chemo 
phototrophic They include species producing methane species tolerant of high 
up to high pressure salt and acid environment They have 
large surface contact with the environment rapid exchange of matter 
energy and the fastest metabolism generation time the time at 
parental generation gives rise new generation may only take minutes 
are able to synthesize up to amino acids in one 
They make up about one half of the biomass living 
of the world There are typically million bacteria cells in 
of soil and million bacteria cells in millilitre of fresh 
They live in water in bodies of other organisms and 
spread through the air They are mainly found in the 
where they take part in mineralization of remains of plant 
animal bodies Through the decomposition of their proteins ammonia is 
and ammonium salts are then oxidized by nitrifying bacteria into 
and nitrates and these are the source of plant nutrition 
nitrogen fixing bacteria such as Azotobacter and Rhizobium are involved 
the nitrogen cycle by binding to their proteins and nucleic 
of atmospheric nitrogen Azotobacter lives and fixes nitrogen independently of 
organisms On the other hand Rhizobium fixes nitrogen after entering 
nodules of legume plants Conversely denitrifying bacteria deprive soil of 
and nitrites as they reduce them to molecular Bacteria are 
involved in the carbon cycle the source of carbon dioxide 
is released into the atmosphere by the oxidization activity 
organisms respiration of plants animals fermentation of chemoheterotrophous bacteria The 
is source of carbon for all photoautotrophic organisms especially 
the subkingdom Viridiplantae green plants Another element whose cycle is 
by the bacteria is sulphur Sulphur is contained in many 
in plant and animal bodies Saprophytic bacteria release sulphide from 
residues utilized by phototrophic sulphur bacteria as source of hydrogen 
is then oxidized to sulphate by chemoautotrophous bacteria which is 
to plants Green plants are of fundamental importance to heterotrophic 
as essential primary producers of organic matter Eukaryote The most 
advanced organisms belong to eukaryotic domain whose minimum building unit 
of all basic life functions is eukaryotic cell cell where 
information molecule DNA is localized in the nucleus enclosed by 
The most important evolutionary branches include eukaryotic protozoa and chromista 
as soil organisms fungi animals as heterotrophic organisms and plants 
as producers of organic matter autotrophic organisms Evolutionary history of 
plants Once plants had reached the land there were two 
to dealing with desiccation The bryophytes avoid it or give 
to it restricting their ranges to moist settings or drying 
and putting their metabolism on hold until more water arrives 
resist desiccation they all bear waterproof outer cuticle layer wherever 
are exposed to air as some bryophytes do to reduce 
loss but since total covering would cut them off from 
in the atmosphere they rapidly evolved stomata small openings allowing 
the gas exchange Tracheophytes also developed vascular tissue to aid 
the movement of water within the organisms and moved away 
gametophyte dominated life cycle Vascular tissue also facilitated upright growth 
the support of water and paved the way for the 
of larger plants on land Cooksonia Rhynia and Psilophyton are 
first known vascular plants Tracheophytes They lived from the upper 
to early Devonian million years ago and they were leafless 
rootless plants consisted of stem tissue which branched along an 
Their bodies already had an epidermis with stomata and these 
plants had ingeniously invented chemical called lignin that toughens the 
of plant cells The earliest documented plant of this type 
Cooksonia but complete fossil material was not found yet On 
other hand complete fossils were found for Rhynia plants The 
of Rhynia exhibit maximum diameter of mm and the plant 
attained height of up to cm Psilophyton is genus with 
complex structure than any other plants of comparable age Rhynia 
is thought to be part of the group from which 
modern ferns and seed plants evolved forbesii is the largest 
species of Psilophyton Reconstructions suggest that they were around cm 
and equipped with more advanced type of tracheid However no 
of this family reached tree growth because of isometric growth 
uniform in all directions which would not be functionally and 
sustainable in larger sizes Pteridophytes clubmosses horsetails ferns and progymnosperms 
group of vascular plants where diploid sporophyte with double set 
chromosomes in the cell nuclei predominates over gametophyte which is 
with one set of chromosomes in individual lives Trees with 
height of and diameter of cm measured at breast height 
ground appeared for the first time in the history of 
flora between the middle and late Devonian million years ago 
then they have been gaining in size in all dimensions 
in the stem diameter The earliest known trees originated in 
Wattieza genus At those times lush and dense vegetation spread 
humid habitats while dry habitats with low ground water only 
sparse vegetation cover The plants growing in wet habitats were 
for light and this selective pressure was responsible for the 
phylogeny of tree habitus The tree high growth was discovered 
but more or less at the same time in ferns 
Calamophyton clubmosses Protolepidodendropsis Cyclostigma horsetails Psudobornia and progymnosperms Eospermatopteris Archaeopteris 
the same time tree plants especially progymnosperms genus Duisbergia occurred 
drier sparsely populated habitats too In this case the tree 
was advantageous in terms of improving bioclimate in the crown 
avoid temperature fluctuations near the soil surface and in terms 
ability to limit water loss due to massive solid trunk 
also served as reservoir of water and other substances Furthermore 
had an advantage of producing high quality organic matter mineralization 
dead tree parts brings nutrients back into the soil in 
most favourable ratio and form for particular species long life 
slow population growth which was an asset to sustaining stability 
an individual as well as the whole forest Yet trees 
appear in evolution only after satisfying their basic living need 
needed sufficiently developed and deep soil in order to provide 
with solid anchoring and covering of their needs for water 
mineral nutrients Gymnosperms plants conifers cycads Ginkgo seed fern and 
as group of seed producing plants appeared in the Palaeozoic 
million years ago They have an imperfect protection of ovules 
grow freely on scales These ovules ripen into seeds Pollen 
transferred directly onto the naked ovules Male and female micro 
megasporophylls usually form separated male and female cones The pollination 
wind occurs Seed ferns are an extinct group of plants 
tree or liana structures large pinnate leaves resembling fern leaves 
most primitive group of present seed plants are Cycads nowadays 
in tropical and subtropical areas reaching about species class of 
originated in late Paleozoic and gradually spread to large areal 
the Earth In the Tertiary million years ago however most 
species died out and only single species Ginkgo biloba survived 
present flora The first conifers have been known since the 
period million years ago Their greatest era was the Mesozoic 
year ago At present coniferous forests cover approximately one third 
all forest ecosystems area Angiosperms Flowering plants Magnoliophyta dicots and 
appeared at the end of the Mesozoic in Late Cretaceous 
years ago Angiosperms differ from their predecessors by the position 
ovules inside the carpel gynoecium enclosed seeds in fruits and 
with carpel that are usually protected by colourful corolla which 
pollinators Angiosperms offsprings of the Cretaceous era are found nowadays 
tropical and subtropical areas myrtle Magnolia or Liriodendron In higher 
this group is represented by mild climate species such as 
oak birch beech The treelike monocot species do not have 
and full wood stem cylinder stem grows as set of 
petioles and sheaths with possible coappearance with adventitious roots Conductive 
are built from closed vascular bundles which are composed of 
and phloem The xylem typically lies adaxial with phloem positioned 
General characteristics and types of trees The prerequisites for the 
of trees do not only include the capability to build 
multicellural organism vascular architecture but also to synthesize the necessary 
storage defence and regulatory substances These include accumulation of the 
and other substances into the cells starch proteins fats or 
of the defence system anthocyanins tannins dyes aromatic and bitter 
saponins glycosides alkaloids or metabolic waste products crystals of calcium 
and calcium carbonate into the cell walls cellulose hemicellulose 
substances cutin and other high molecular weight waxes lignins suberin 
mucilaginous substances or into specialized locations resins essential oils 
gum rubber and many others Woody plants are perennial plants 
woody stem lives for at least two growing seasons raspberry 
but usually longer from many years exceptionally up to thousands 
years Woody plants are studied by dendrology from Greek dendron 
tree logia science or study However dendrology does not cover 
whole part of the system unlike the case of mycology 
studies exclusively fungi since lot of systematic units include both 
and woody plants within the Ranunculaceae family fig buttercup Ficaria 
is typical herb and old man beard Clematis vitalba is 
lian or within the genus of Sambucus there is herbaceous 
dwarf elder Sambucus ebulus while individuals of elderberry Sambucus nigra 
as woody plants shrub or tree Moreover there are number 
herbs able to build woody stems strong and solid enough 
lateral branches that structurally correspond to woody species wormwood Atriplex 
but these species are not considered as trees since their 
ground systems die in the same year as they originate 
plants Plantae lignosae are perennial plants with woody above ground 
root systems exclusively adapted to the terrestrial environment They can 
divided into Holoxyles whose stems lignify in the same growing 
as they elongate and Hemixyles whose stems fully lignify only 
late as the following season in autumn their apical parts 
still herbal pendant as they lack strength such as blueberry 
an unlignified part is damaged in rest season this does 
present grave loss to plant The opposite is true if 
survives hemixyle has an advance when the photosynthesis starts at 
beginning of the next growing season According to plant design 
woody plants can be distinguished as trees distinct main trunk 
unbranched in its lower part the height may vary depending 
the species and conditions from just few cm such as 
or bonsai to more than shrubs higher than not developing 
main trunk with the stem branching of its basal part 
or below the soil surface Trees have large extensive root 
which passes into compact spaceminimized intense and clearly established trunk 
the soil surface trunk branches at certain height above the 
and carries crown The crown usually grows in its periphery 
height and width and the stem can be found either 
full length spruce or it may soon form strong numerous 
branches as solitary broadleaf Shrubs woody cushion plants and creeping 
plants also have extensive above and below ground systems but 
not build trunk they develop new and stronger branches from 
lower buds close to the soil surface Shrubs with root 
covered in the soil are known as chtonophytes Above ground 
of woody cushion plants also have nearly hemispherical shape with 
short shoots around the surface The surface of such compact 
is relatively small related to the volume of the occupied 
such shrub is thus protected from temperature fluctuations and drying 
Above ground parts of creeping woody plants are pressed against 
surface of the soil cotoneaster and the ends of branches 
be ascending Epiphytic shrubs grow on other plants usually trees 
can also be currant yew tree and number of other 
and such trees as rowan or maple growing on other 
and generally not forming trunk in these unfavourable conditions They 
not harm the host plant if there is enough space 
the crown or if the host plant falls and the 
plant reaches the soil surface Though typical tropical and subtropical 
may outgrow host tree and kill it strangler Hemiparasitic shrubs 
as yellow mistletoe and European mistletoe are connected with their 
plants directly by haustoria they prosper in the top sunlit 
of tree crown where their green leaves produce organic matter 
their own use Fig They withdraw solutions from the host 
that were obtained with great energy lost from the soil 
pulled up against the force of gravity These shrubs often 
spherical shape whose surface is ideal for capturing solar radiation 
reducing excessive water loss by evaporation into the air Fig 
branch infested by yellow mistletoe Loranthus europeaus The branch top 
dyed as nutrients and water were taken by mistletoe Woody 
can be divided into several types entwine their stems perform 
movements at their apices which serve to wrap around support 
they grow get thicker and can graft among coils Dutchman 
Aristolochia macrophylla Chinese wisteria Wisteria sinensis prop often shortened reverse 
or emergencies prickly outgrowths of bark which hold lians on 
substrate blackberry Rubus fruticosus with tendrils such as grapevine Vitis 
with tendrils with suction pads as Japanese ivy Parthenocissus tricuspidata 
aerial rootlets with matted pads form as adventitious roots on 
without absorption function such as English ivy Hedera helix Material 
energy investments are dedicated to their linear extension growth and 
transport system connecting leaves with roots over long distances Calamus 
reach length of up to Stems lack self supporting systems 
they are dependent on the support plant in reaching the 
area Sometimes lians are also referred to as skeleton parasites 
is when they climb as high as the crown of 
tree overshadow it and let the tree gradually die What 
the benefits of trees large volume of occupied soil gives 
better chance of getting the necessary amount of water and 
nutrients they can accumulate storage substances of organic nature water 
nutrients in their bulky bodies so that they could overcome 
periods for growth The lignified stems branches and trunks carry 
buds which can easily replace lost crown parts damaged by 
drought wind fire vast foliage area is produced very 
at the beginning of the growing season which is an 
over herbs in the use of solar radiation for photosynthesis 
also extends the growing season Reaching an area of faster 
and milder temperature fluctuations makes their reproductive structures better protected 
can also utilize air movement for propagating pollen and diasporas 
seeds and shoot fragments capable of rooting such as crack 
Salix fragilis All growth forms of woody plants support the 
of large forests and bushes Cooperative relations between individuals by 
grafts mutual shading creating favourable temperature and humidity conditions mitigating 
damage by wind together with competitive relations competition for 
nutrients oxygen and symbionts in the soil the favourable irradiance 
the soil surface are run in plant societies corresponding to 
environmental conditions In this context trees can reach ages and 
close to the species potential optimal Trees are the most 
growth form In unfavourable conditions many tree species shift to 
form when they grow old Disadvantages of tree growth and 
solutions The main disadvantages of trees are high demands on 
by photosynthates that arise in green parts of plants especially 
leaves but also in petioles and young stems These green 
must produce enough energy to cover needs of the extensive 
of the below and above ground systems the annual creation 
new functional conductive pathways and mechanical and static stability of 
organism and for securing covering tissues to new and growing 
surfaces Photosynthates are also needed for the synthesis of materials 
of defence structures forming osmoregulatory substances symbioses investment mycorrhizal fungi 
for making their own storage supplies for survival periods of 
and resuming growth in spring Adult trees also have increasing 
for security of generative sexual reproduction the formation of flowers 
and seeds In all these conditions foliage of trees works 
much lower level of hydration than the herbs or low 
do This is because the driving force for transport from 
to leaves water potential difference between these two points in 
must be large enough to overcome any resistance that may 
on the long flow pathway of water from the soil 
the atmosphere The growth and stability of tree depends largely 
the vulnerability of the thinnest place stem The conductive and 
systems of stem are oversized several fold in healthy individuals 
material and energy input into the structure of tree cannot 
reused even in the condition of critical starvation Many tree 
are able to reach the optimal design in unfavourable conditions 
means to exclude stem recover branches from the stem base 
the distance between leaves and roots reduce the demands of 
water regime in other words to shift from the tree 
to the shrub growth We can seldom encounter the opposite 
rejection of the injured stem so that the roots grow 
the base of the crown under bark or through the 
in the stem towards the soil Thus the support and 
functions of the stem are partially replaced and at the 
time the resistance of solutions movement is reduced on the 
from soil plant atmosphere system Slow wood production together with 
speed of the radial growth of branches branch overhanging are 
tree strategies leading to efficient energy balance Tree reaction on 
unfavourable condition Tree species as long living plants do not 
only under favourable conditions for their existence growth and reproduction 
energy demands are required by tree to overcome unfavourable conditions 
stress which cannot be just escaped from by trees physically 
they are immobile organisms with fixed root systems in particular 
The process of disturbance and reaching new equilibrium takes place 
the level of cell membranes and organelles and it extends 
individual cells plant tissues especially meristematic photosynthetic and conductive and 
organs leaves roots Finally it also concerns whole individuals autonomous 
of the ecosystem whether natural or artificial At first there 
stress stimulus whereupon stress response is triggered By the term 
we understand the factors of external or internal environment that 
the organism threat to its functional relations The stress response 
change of the functional status bent branches for light absorption 
diversion of branches and their growth from consistently irritate subject 
remodelling or termination of elongation growth of roots in compacted 
and restoration of root growth in more positive direction
outcome of the stress response which individual tree species are 
with regarding the conditions of the areas of their original 
may include avoiding the effects of the stressor inner leaves 
auxiliary buds of woody cushion plants are hidden from temporary 
and heat adaptation which means adapting of sensitive structures so 
it can withstand the effect of the stressor the sunlight 
with modified inner structure carried on short branches in clusters 
more tolerant to repeated insufficient water supply resistance to certain 
of stressor achieving resistance for example vegetative buds of conifers 
deciduous trees can resist freezing to in the areas with 
and tough winters in the short summer this resistance is 
These examples are known as eustress which is stress essential 
life driving force of changes leading to the ability to 
in given environment even optimal The failure of stress response 
destabilization or even death of an individual is caused by 
or more conditions the sum of whose is known as 
It is the destructive effect of the impact to sensitive 
Stress response goes through certain stages The alarm stage is 
pledge of all existing functions in particular the synthesis of 
agents and growth restriction Affected tissue respirate heavily and break 
existing structure catabolism predominates over anabolism but spiral shock may 
and cause acute damage and death such as peripheral parts 
leaves due to salt or bleached districts in immature leaf 
due to intense solar radiation The restitution stage could 
resulting in the correction processes of protein synthesis and protective 
or even replacing the lost parts by new growth Regularly 
stressors during phylogeny of species are preceded by plant precautions 
hardening stage During this stage the components of cell membranes 
substituted osmotically active substances are released to free water to 
the formation of ice crystals Trees can achieve resistance 
gradual preparation see above Sometimes chronic injury can be observed 
cases when changes and changing stressors occur irregularly range of 
responses are nonspecific On the cell level changes in the 
activity reductases glutathione peroxidases biosynthesis of polyamines and antioxidants ascorbic 
and tocopherol the type and content of the osmoticum proline 
and polyol the synthesis of secondary compounds polyphenols anthocyanins terpenes 
of stress hormones abscisic acid jasmonic ethylene changes in the 
of membranes increased respiration and decreased photosynthesis The result of 
changes in the relationship between respiration and photosynthesis increasing the 
of is the depletion of the trees and 
lack of promptly available energy The production of biomass is 
living matter growth irregularities and reduced fertility occur poor internal 
of growth results in the allometric relation changes between production 
and consumption parts and furthermore tree gets old prematurely increased 
dead matter of crown stem roots Internal factors that determine 
susceptibility or resistance of trees to given stressor or complex 
stressors are taxon and eco element shady sunny xerophyt mesophyt 
ontogenetic stage dormant stage or stage of vegetation activity Ontogeny 
tree growth Tree growth no matter which evolutionary branch it 
to can be characterised by the following conditions trees must 
mechanically stable energy to grow and support structures is provided 
leaves aqueous solutions of the nutrients must be received mainly 
the soil and quickly transported to the leaves organic materials 
of leaf synthesis need to be conducted fast enough and 
required quantities to the shoots flowers fruits branches stems and 
all parts of tree need to have sufficient available storage 
for water nutrients and storage substances These characteristics are essentially 
as all conditions must be met and all require energy 
the resulting structure and shape of the plants is their 
This compromise may be reached in the ontogeny in the 
of individuals from seedlings to adult trees by these means 
system stem and crown develop simultaneously such as spruce beech 
appearance is preceded by the initial phase roots and leaves 
while the stem grows in diameter Only after achieving the 
foliage area and soil occupancy the trunk will elongate especially 
cycads some angiosperm species that lack the so called secondary 
such as palms dense root system is formed close to 
soil surface at the tree base false trunk is formed 
intense branching extinct ferns and present polycormons palm trees epiphytes 
in crowns of host trees too may present the initial 
of trees ontogeny They let aerial roots down to the 
surface that gradually grow thicker and stronger thus forming stem 
expands in the soil into an independent root system some 
of the genus Ficus Ontogenetic stages can be divided in 
periods the dependence stage the period when young plant uses 
reserves stored from the endosperm or cotyledons and the independence 
when photosynthesis has become active heterotrophic period the individual life 
on photosynthates supplied by the parent plant namely seed stage 
germination autotrophic period when the new plants can produce and 
their own organic inputs for their growth and development germination 
the full function of the first assimilation leaves juvenile stage 
is typical for example in thin Norway spruce needles still 
into the shady and sunny type virginal stage tree habitat 
similar to the adult tree but still does not flower 
give seeds and fruits stage of younger adulthood from the 
bloom It should occur after the achievement of the required 
of the stock compartment In fruit and ornamental trees it 
before they reach years if the vegetative propagation or grafting 
used it can emerge even much sooner Domestic forest trees 
at the age of several decades after an almost final 
of the crown is reached repeated strong stressor such as 
and lateral contraction of roots in nurseries could promote early 
in these trees stage of middle adulthood mean maximum crown 
root space is reached and quality seeds are produced stage 
late adulthood rounding or downsizing top of the crown with 
branched species reducing the amount of crown dieback of deep 
and gradual transition to flat root system senescence stage prevalence 
necromass over biomass reduced fertility reduced seed germination stage of 
tree survives by few branches associated with narrow strip of 
with partly living roots death of the individual Trees are 
sensitive to stress factors in the younger ontogenetic stages However 
adapt most efficiently to their environment just in these stages 
seedlings live or at least survive on very unfavourable sites 
the other hand the shock from transplanting from nursery where 
were growing in the optimal conditions fertilization irrigation soil aeration 
into the environment dramatically different and unfavourable compacted soil changes 
temperature humidity light condition can meet the tree species unprepared 
could lead to numerous and repeated plantings mortalities At the 
of tree life from late adulthood its adaptability is reduced 
sensitivity to changing and frequent occurrence of stressors increases Dynamic 
tree activity During the long life of trees rhythms and 
term cycles of increased and decreased activity get repeated The 
rhythm is daily circadian and is associated with changing light 
dark parts of the day In the light part photosynthesis 
prevail and towards the end of the night when trees 
have the greatest water content intense volume growth of cells 
occur Some sensitive plants demonstrate monthly the circa lunar rhythm 
is related to the increasing and decreasing moonlight intensity The 
of most species of our flora is clearly subject to 
annual cycle cycle circa annual changes due to the change 
seasons spring summer autumn and winter when the driving factor 
the temperature The daily rhythm depends on the proportion of 
length of day and night on the photoperiod whose changes 
related to the annual cycle In our latitudes the light 
of the day extends from the spring equinox to the 
half of June with the longest day and shortest night 
the night gradually lengthens and by midJuly the nights get 
change termoperiodicity temperature difference between hot day and cold nights 
the second half of September the length of day and 
is equal autumn equinox and then the night lengthens until 
Since the end of December till March the light is 
the increase again Many of our trees are already at 
stage of cold enforced rest post dormancy in the early 
part of the annual cycle It depends on the weather 
development especially on the last freezing days in February If 
is warm some trees poplar birch would already begin the 
of their roots or flower buds hazel Many trees and 
bud and bloom in April gradually moving to the stage 
full vegetation activity June July exception is for example lilac 
already declined to an internally controlled dormancy at that time 
the length of the light part of day cooling at 
and typical weak rainfall result in trees accumulation of substances 
limit cell division and growth accelerate fruit ripening and leaf 
and finally cause falling leaves in the internally controlled hibernation 
dormancy It is not rule that summer weather is favourable 
tree species every year Plant drying hydroperiodicity may occur in 
rainy years and at higher temperatures Trees may respond to 
by early calming of their growth initiatives the forced rest 
dormancy In more favourable year it often happens that even 
for which such behaviour is unnatural begins blooming again Horse 
Aesculus hippocastanum for which considerable amount of energy is lost 
released from deep dormancy are driven by internal phytohormonal relations 
particular the level of abscisic acid ABA by the action 
frost temperatures and higher insulation condition which decay ABA Unlike 
deciduous trees conifers Norway spruce lack internal control and only 
an imposed rest Also during the annual cycle periods dangerous 
trees may be identified It is mostly in spring and 
the transitional period in which the likelihood of fluctuating temperatures 
high Late frosts in spring damage young shoots or worse 
meristems of trunks and branches In autumn early frosts may 
when the trees have not ripen yet the late part 
the annual rings completed lignification of summer wood The highest 
is in the period of rapid growth Trees are most 
during their dormancy time of minimised metabolism and energy exchange

are reduced and growth is interrupted Plant Cell Eukaryotic cell

these Their interior space is divided by thylakoids into the

into the actual cell and even from generation to generation 
cells as well as organisms It is separated from the 
by double membrane with pores interconnected with the endoplasmatic reticulum 
contains nucleolus nucleous matrix with ribosomes nucleoproteins and chromatin nucleic 
that function as genetic apparatus These are heterobiopolymers based on 
specific sequence of nucleotides with purine base adenine guanine or 
cytosine thymine in DNA and cytosine uracil in RNA These 
also contain saccharide pentose deoxyribose in DNA ribose in RNA 
phosphate group DNA has shape of double helix opposite bases 
both the fibres connected only by hydrogen bond are equal 
opposite thymine guanine opposite cytosine The specification of these acids 
given by the sequence of nucleotides whose triplets encode specific 
acid and the sequence of triplets is given by the 
of amino acids in proteins New DNA molecules are always 
of already existing ones After the double helix molecule is 
and its two fibres are separated new copies of these 
are synthesised so that two new molecules were made from 
original one replication reduplication Proteins are heteropolymers as they are 
of the selection of more than amino acids in various 
various number of repetition of individual passages various lengths of 
chain and various possibilities of spacial arrangement Taking into account 
these variations they have different characteristics as building blocks and 
of enzymes and this makes them the primary source of 
variability of life forms and originality of each individual The 
of proteins proceeds in several stages In the nucleolus according 
the model unwound DNA passage the sequence code of bases 
transcript into three types of RNA mediator ribosomal and transfer 
Then these molecules undergo transformations mutation cutting out extra passages 
making new connections and then they move from the nucleolus 
the cytoplasm Double body ribosomes with rRNA ribosomes aggregation makes 
join the mRNA fibre and when moving along the fibre 
match with individual activated amino acids transferred from the tRNA 
according to the triplet sequence several equal molecules of individual 
are generally synthesised in this way They originate by the 
of information from DNA These proteins are placed into ER 
where they are checked and transported into the places of 
or placed into the Golgi apparatus for further syntheses Cell 
The individual cell genesis ontogenesis is divided into the division 
stage embryonic the elongation stage and the differentiation stage towards 
function Cell division cytokinesis is followed by the division of 
nucleus karyokinesis Nucleous DNA condenses spiralizes and connects with single 
histones to form chromosomes Nucleus membrane gets dissolved chromosomes undergo 
division and half of each moves to the daughter nuclei 
to cytoskeleton nucleus equation division mitosis In the newly formed 
transported DNA molecules chromosomes are resolved into the functional simple 
structure and the nucleous structure is renewed The amount of 
in daughter cells rises to the original value by means 
replication Cytoplasm as well as all other cell structures including 
membrane are multiplied and the cells prepare for further replication 
cells or shift towards the next ontogenetic stage Healthy cells 
by the mitotic cell division have an even number diploid 
chromosomes each chromosome type is represented twice there in case 
yew tree the cell nuclei comprise of chromosomes in spruce 
and pine and in maple The gametes genesis male and 
sexual cells is preceded by another karyokinesis type meiosis It 
to the creation of cell nuclei with basic set of 
haploid which are greatly transformed by the mutual replacement of 
between pairs of mutually corresponding homologue chromosomes new individual initiates 
the fusion of male gamete nucleus generative nucleus of pollen 
base chromosome set with female gamete nucleus ovum cell nucleus 
also comprises of base number of chromosomes This creates zygote 
first cell of new individual having double set of chromosomes 
of whose comes from the mother and the other from 
father organism In angiospermous plants there is an extra fusion 
the second nucleus of pollen having basic number of chromosomes 
the central nucleus of the embryo sac which is diploid 
is how triploid endosperm is made It feeds the plant 
until it matures The nucleus division or fusion of nuclei 
followed by the cell division cytokinesis Regarding cytoplasm and its 
the division is not even Some elements reach the daughter 
transformed plastids virus element so daughter and mother cells 
not equal this causes unevenly coloured stripes or segments of 
For instance it is the prime division of zygote that 
decides which of the daughter cells shall become the basis 
the above ground and root structures Onwards root cells censure 
deal of information that could be used in photosynthesis or 
Similarly mother cells of xylem and phloem are distinct though 
were initiated in the same cambial initial In theory all 
cells include all information needed to create new plant of 
species this allows for the vegetative reproduction sprout with encoded 
on how to build and form shoots develops on root 
roots may as well be formed on shoot In general 
the embryonic growth stage there are intense syntheses of nucleous 
lipids proteins The plant needs lot of nitrogen and phosphor 
growth regulators of the greatest influence involve cytokines and gibberellins 
above described stage of the cell division growth is closed 
the construction of new partition cell wall Its first layer 
of proteins mainly pectates salts of pectate acids It is 
middle lamella or intercellular matter After that the new cells 
vacuoles they get filled with water their pressure from the 
of the cell wall rises and they grow in size 
of cell may increase of up to to times The 
of an extending wall is finalized by the primary lamella 
macromolecules homobiopolymers of glucose residues are inserted into the lamella 
get arranged in crystalline microfibrils Microfibrils may be more or 
well structured interconnected by pectates and hemicellulose besides glucose they 
saccharide xylose with lower proportion of protein The new matter 
inserted by means of intussusceptions the wall grows in size 
does not prevent the volume growth of protoplast However bonds 
wall parts are weak cell wall is not solid and 
as fluid crystal and this makes the cell susceptible to 
changes in shape After the shape has been stabilized the 
stage of the volume growth is closed What ensues from 
description of this stage is that plant mainly needs water 
it is the force that extends growing cells and develops 
pressure on the neighbourhood Another needed matter is organically bound 
saccharides widely used for the formation of cell walls Regarding 
substances gibberellins are the ones that are most important at 
stage As cells enter the differentiation growth stage depending on 
future specific function they build secondary layered lamellae to strengthen 
cell wall The lamella is formed by the apposition of 
layers from the inside of cell the middle layer is 
first the primary one follows and the secondary is formed 
The building substances include cellulose hemicellulose lignin suberin cutin waxes 
dioxide carbonates sporopolenines Since this is centripetal growth from 
periphery towards the centre the reverse process centrifugal growth occurs 
cell wall formation of pollen the protoplast area might be 
to such an extent that cell could not survive In 
cases particularly in skeleton cells or xylem conductive cells with 
pressure conditions from overpressure to underpressure as low as MPa 
secondary lamella is formed unevenly Precise direction and laying construction 
driven by cytoskeleton and complex structures is form Pits simple 
branched ones mediate connection and communication through plasmodesmata cell wall 
lined with cytoplasmatic membrane that connect the protoplasts of adjacent 
among cells as well as organs by means of long 
medium distance diffusion which helps sustain balance in an individual 
pits in gymnospermous tracheid walls and even perforations in vessels 
ducts enable material flow on long distances Various types of 
round spiral step matrix prevent from cell deformations phloem and 
fibres sklereid Construction and material structure of cell walls 
their basic characteristics insolubility in water anisotropy birefringence in polarized 
and spacial distinct changes in volume during growth but also 
ability to communicate with the neighbouring cells or water and 
permeability There are numerous instances when the cell wall features 
not compatible with protoplast existence so after the wall is 
protoplast dies out and its functions mainly mechanic conductive are 
over by the cell wall There are two types of 
on the differentiation stage of cell life endogenous genetic enzymatic 
activities and exogenous climatic soil topographic relief and morphology and 
galls on leaves brought about by fault cell differentiation as 
impact of insect activity There is an increase in the 
of mineral sources and the demand on the optimal photosynthesis 
respiration Some kinds of already specialized cells are capable of 
return to the embryonic stage and could restart division This 
why surface injuries may regenerate and heal Tissues Woody species 
true tissues originated from single cell and are defined as 
of cells of the same shape and functions They share 
common features For instance the cell walls are interconnected by 
material middle lamellae comprised of calcium magnesium pectates Life cell 
are interconnected by plasmodesmata with the tubular endoplasmatic reticulum By 
of these all life cells of the whole system form 
unit symplast It can actively transport by speeded up diffusion 
that have been formed or transported through cytoplasmatic membranes in 
part of plant Another feature of tissues is the presence 
intracellular spaces They are formed in three different ways schizogenous 
splitting of middle lamellae in corners of cells or between 
cells of epidermis or by tissue injury when intracellular material 
walls may be dissolved Fig rhexigenous by tearing off tissues 
to fast growth of neighbouring tissues in pith especially in 
liane stems lyzigenous by dissolving of cells essence reservoirs isolated 
lignified or corked walls of neighbouring cells Fig Schizogenous intercellular 
Resin duct in the pine needle developed by splitting of 
lamellae of secretory cells Intercellulars hold substantial role in transport 
gases and water in leaf spongy parenchyma leaf hydathodes and 
filling tissue and in concentration and isolation of protective substances 
canals and silicae containers Schizogenous intercellulars with aeration functions grow 
decreased aeration in inner tissues in roots during soil flooding 
stems and branches lay on the ground They give 
tissue its name aerenchyma Intercellular areas except for excretion glandule 
and laticifer ducts as well as interior areas of dead 
cells vascular bundles create an apoplastic matrix communication system which 
matters in gaseous liquid and solid phases without crossing barriers 
cell membranes Even saproparasite organisms could spread through the apoplast 
are commonly present in tissues these are cells that considerably 
from the majority of cells by the shape type of 
cell wall sclerid or by the contents crystals tannin in 
tannin cells near phloem in spruce Tissues are categorised 
various criteria From the perspective of cell wall type cell 
and function these tissues are distinguished Fig parenchyma thin walled 
mainly living capable of division metabolic storage functions collenchyma 
cells with unevenly thickened cell walls If they thicken at 
corners this is called angular collenchyma if thickened walls are 
to the organ surface this is called tangential collenchyma if 
contains intercellulars it is known as lacunar collenchyma it acts 
mechanical support metabolic support it can renew division and give 
to healing tissue sclerenchyma tissues that contain mainly dead cells 
function is taken over by strong lignified walls The walls 
filled with various types of narrowings as well as thickenings 
or spiral ones that do not slow down the elongation 
of neighbouring cells or matrix and staircase thickening that occur 
the parts of plant where the elongation growth is no 
as active as it used to be Sclerenchyma cells have 
supporting and transportation functions They transport solution from roots to 
above ground parts Fig Tissues division from the perspective of 
wall type and cell lifespan parenchyma collenchyma and sclerenchyma There 
two types of cell from the perspective of cell shape 
star shaped spongy pallisade and prosenchymatic highly elongated cells 
the perspective of the rate of differentiation the following types 
defined meristem dividing embryonic which never reaches growth and differentiation 
localized in growth zones as apical primary meristems on stem 
and root tips or on growing section of leaf and 
secondary meristems By cell differentiating meristem gives rise to permanent 
also divided into primary and secondary ones They are functionally 
into the systems of covering vascular and basic tissues The 
of primary meristem The whole tree organism originates in single 
called zygote It is the initial cell of an offspring 
which was formed by the fusion of sperm cell male 
an ovum female cell called gamete Zygote is bipolar there 
exists physiological difference which later when organs and whole organisms 
formed directs the flow of material photosynthates hormones and other 
substances This polarity also directs the formation of adventitious roots 
buds from stem and root In case of stem new 
are formed at basal proximal cutting area and new buds 
apical distal poles it is opposite in root sections The 
polarity defines the basic features of root and above ground 
as early as the first cell division The onward cell 
with genetic regulation leads to the creation of an embryo 
plant Embryo contains all merismatic cells cells capable of intense 
mature embryo contains radicula later develops into the primary root 
primary part below cotyledons stem part bearing primary leaves cotyledons 
plants have one dicotyledonous have two gymnospermous have multiple cotyledons

buds and epicotyls between cotyledons primary above cotyledon part of

meristems All cells of plant divide during the germination and 
but they gradually lose dividing capability They start growing towards 
base in proximal direction and focus on special functions in 
on their positions This means that meristems move in distal 
above ground grows towards the sunlight and to the root 
grow in direction of gravity Dividing character is retained only 
the apical cell groups initials that occur at the main 
apex later in lateral roots and on the stem apex 
lateral shoots Fig and The initials are directly connected to 
embryo cells archimeristems and together with the newly divided or 
being divided derivates they form protomeristem Its older derivates still 
of dividing form protoderm giving rise to the primary epidermis 
procambium whose dividing cells arranged in stripes differentiate into primary 
tissues xylem and phloem and the basic meristem predecessor of 
pith pith rays in stems and roots mesophyll in leaves 
protoderm procambium and basic meristem are primary apical meristems responsible 
the elongation growth and for the formation of set of 
permanent tissues their spacial arrangement decides on the primary structure 
organs The meristems may retain in the latent state suppressed 
for long time They generate leaves and buds in their 
as basics of lateral branches Suppressed buds are storage which 
easily regenerate plant On the other hand they can lead 
the formation of various tumours by pathogens Between stem nods 
leaves from the primary meristems there is an intercalary meristem 
allows for later elongation of internodes The shape of leaves 
from different activity of the residue meristems on the basis 
and edge of their blades Fig Primary meristems of shoot 
Leaf primordia protect apical meristem Axillary buds are form in 
leaf primordia base Fig Primary meristem of root apex Root

Lateral root are form later The primary structure of stems 
roots is typical to some herbs in Ranunculaceae family and 
woods that do not secondarily grow in diameter The structure 
the other woods that form secondary meristems is more complicated 
appearance can be well described by means of three mutually 
sections The cross section is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 
an organ The radial section is longitudinal and crosses the 
of an organ The tangential section is longitudinal too but 
does not reach the centre it remains at the periphery 
primary tissues system of primary surface tissues The differentiation of 
derivates in above ground organs leads to the formation of 
unwettable epidermis covered with cuticle and epicuticle wax from the 
If epidermis is multilevel then the inner layer is call 
It is gas proof except for stomata it protects the 
tissues from UV radiation which effectively absorb and it serves 
water reservoir By means of opening and closing stomata it 
plant from withering overheating by transpiration distribution of water gas 
air and from biotic factors Trichomes outgrowths of epidermis cells 
helping to fulfil epidermis functions These trichomes might be single 
or multicellular Fig branched or unbranched glandular More massive formations 
called emergencies which consist not only of epidermis but also 
tissues Fig These involve prickles rose raspberry glandules in ash 
or chestnut shoots or pollen section in flowers Fig Multicellular 
of Viburnum rhytidophyllum Fig Prickles emergencies of rose They consist 
only of epidermis but also inner tissues Unlike spines they 
form irregularly In case of roots rhisodermis is formed It 
weak cell walls it is less water and gas resistant 
swell when wet it has no cuticles or stomata The 
produces acids and exoenzymes that disturb the substrate and nutrients 
contain osmosis active solutions cells lack chloroplasts stomata cutin and 
but they have leucoplasts There are rhizomes parallel to trichomes 
unlike those they have the absorption function They are shorter 
less condensed in trees than in herbs they are lacking 
case of root colonisation by mycorrhytic fungi Taking into view 
characteristics of rhisodermis roots are very sensitive to drying out 
roots of seed plants removed from the soil left in 
sunshine and on dry air may die in couple of 
system of primary basic tissues Primary cork called cortex is 
multicellular tissue between the epidermis and vascular tissues In roots 
layer exodermis cells have protective functions corked later replaced the 
medium layer mesoderm have transportation and storage functions Endodermis inner 
is made by cells with widened corked stripe of cell 
Casparian strip and cells above vascular tissue that are permeable 
is means of endodermis control intake of substances into vascular 
in the central cylinder Primary cork of shoots has photosynthesis 
storage function life parenchyma cells and mechanical function collenchyma and 
Life primary cork cells are capable of remeristemation after an 
The primary cork is linked to the central stem and 
parts by the pith rays They secure horizontal transport of 
oxygen from the atmosphere and saccharides from xylem to dividing 
growing cells in the cambial zone Pith ray cells are 
of crystals phenolic and toxic substances there are horizontal resin 
in many gymnospermous plants Pith occurs inside stems hardly ever 
roots Its thin walled cells in young stems may contain 
or starch later on secretions and lignin in cell walls 
tissues involve mesophyll in leaves tissue with photosynthetic functions It 
the most significant producer source of saccharides molecules rich in 
adenosintriphosphate These are formed using solar energy for the 
transformation of atmospheric carbon dioxide and water Basic tissues have 
of functions assimilation reservoir mechanical collenchyma sclerenchyma and excretive hydatods 
resin ducts system of vascular tissues It is vascular 
that interconnect distant parts of plant by means of distributing 
substances saccharides regulation molecules Vascular bundles may be complete containing 
xylem and phloem parts or one of these parts may 
absent incomplete vascular bundles apical parts of tree tops or 
mesophyll Their primary structure is retained in monocotyledonous woods and 
ferns and their arrangement is scattered and vascular bundles are 
concentric phloem centric phloem is surrounded by xylem Pteridophytes or 
collateral centripetal xylem and centrifugal phloem palm trees Such vascular 
could be divided in two subgroups at the final stage 
the development older protoxylem thinner vessels cell walls are reinforced 
circle or spiral thickening and protophloem with obliterate or dilatate 
functional cells The latter is younger with fully developed and 
efficient younger metaxylem with broad tracheids or vessels and metaphloem 
functional sieve tube and sieve cells The mentioned vascular bundles 
created by general and complete differentiation of procambium strips Vascular 
in stems of gymnospermous and dicotyledonous woody plants are collateral 
procambium stripes are only partially differentiated so cambium between the 
and xylem remains active arranged in circle separated by rays 
lies on the periphery of pith and metaxylem is located 
As early as the first year of stem development the 
neighbours with the secondary xylem deuteroxylem in stems and roots 
passage is gradual it may even be less perceptible On 
edge of the central cylinder there is protophloem which is 
more functional centripetal metaphloem and towards cambium there is completed 
phloem deuterophloem In early stages of development roots have radial 
system whose individual incomplete vascular bundles rays where xylem and 
groups are alternating Vessels in monocotyledonous roots are organized in 
groups Gymnospermous and dicotyledonous plants have usually monarch one group 
xylem and phloem diarch two groups of xylem and floem 
three groups of xylem and phloem fine roots Cambium in 
and dicotyledonous roots start to form below the phloem groups 
above xylem groups later on The radial vessel bundle passes 
multiple open collateral vessel bundles arranged in circle and separated 
phloem xylem rays Secondary meristems Cambium Primary structure in woody 
is retained only for short time Procambium is active and 
into the secondary lateral meristem cambium Below the outer layers 
tissues epidermis primary cork primary phloem cambial initials form coherent 
of cylinder that appears as cambial circle on the cross 
It contains sections of fascicular cambium responsible for extending of 
bundles and sections of interfascicular cambium giving rise to phloemxylem 
Bundle cambial initials are longitudinal in direction of long axis 
an organ and separate mother cells of the secondary xylem 
and mother cells of the secondary phloem in the opposite 
Tranverse partitions between daughter cells are parallel with the surface 
organs periclines When daughter cells arranged in radial lines grow 
whole organs grow with them As early as the first 
of activity some initials of cambium go under such division 
cell walls separating daughter cells are perpendicular to the surface 
the organ anticlines It results in the creation of new 
of interbundle cambium in the rise in diameter of the 
circle and rise in number of vessel bundles and rays 
that case rays do not reach as far as the 
or primary cork Such rays are called secondary phloem xylem 
Intrabundle cambial initials are nearly isodiametric same size in all 
They divide ray cells of the same type in both 
centripetally as well as centrifugally Cambium is responsible for diameter 
of the stem and root systems However while it creates 
annual ring early and late wood in the stem system 
growing season and the number of annual rings more or 
corresponds to the age of tree part in case of 
it is different There are more growth waves in year 
are irregular and their boundaries are less obvious so it 
not that easy to determine their age In evergreens cambium 
in leaves too in veins of the first or second 
and there are more phloem than xylem layers in needles 
is conductive tissues that transport carbohydrates from the locations of 
to the consumption locations meristems root systems flowers fruit or 
In gymnosperms phloem tissue is made of short life sieve 
with dense sieve areas located mainly in cell walls with 
to albuminous cells which neighbour with pith rays In angiospermous 
this tissue is formed by elements of sieve tubes Fig 
tubes are made of cells arranged in vertical lines These 
longer conductive passages Sieve tube elements are elongated in direction 
long axis of an organ and they dissolve cell nuclei 
the process of differentiation This means that they lose the 
bank cannot react to changes that may occur and their 
is extremely shortened Longitudinal cell walls are perforated into the 
area similar to sieve cells but there are large sieve 
on the connection of two sieve tubes Cytoplasmatic membrane passes 
one element to another and distributes organic material esp carbohydrates 
all places of consumption in plant body The content of 
tubes demonstrates positive pressure approx MPa on the inner walls 
solutions may be concentrated even more than and the speed 
transport is approx The sieve pores are plugged by polysaccharides 
originated from glucose remains which is produced and stored at 
end of the growing season This process close conductive pathways 
sieves sooner than usual Sieve tubes may be accompanied by 
parenchyma soft phloem and sclerenchyma fibres hard phloem Nonstrengthened walls 
older sieve tubes allow for the obliteration by the pressure 
the surrounding tissues The pathways are hardly ever active for 
than one growing season in lime or Tsuga canadensis hemlock 
secondary phloem is formed by cells divided by cambial initials 
open vessel bundles of gymnospermous and dicotyledonous woods It is 
each year In monocotyledonous woods phloem centred draceana it can 
stay active without renewal In autumn after the finished elongation 
diameter growth of stem in wood parts of vessel bundles 
could observe protoxylem cells located between typical wood and pith 
are tiny thickwalled Out of the protoxylem xylem cells are 
in diameter metaxylem and finally secondary xylem cells are observed 
early wood and then late wood Small cells from the 
growing season are covered with new layer of early wood 
large diameter cells and thinner cell walls This makes the 
ring border well observable If the growth is not interrupted 
in young trees the number of annual rings on stem 
tell us the tree age Based on the appearance and 
of early and late wood cells deciduous trees are categorized 
ring porose semi ring porose and diffuse porose ones ring 
extremely thick vessels which quickly pass into number of radial 
of thinner vessels and other wood elements with smaller diameters 
tree acacia is formed in spring in trees with ring 
arrangement Regarding semi ring and diffuse porose ones the inner 
of vessels is diminished gradually and the boundaries of annual 
may not be well observable The cambial ring grows in 
as the number of initials multiplies The number of vessel 
and rays slowly grows The rays that were formed at 
plant origin stretching from the pith to the primary cork 
called primary and the ones that were formed later are 
as secondary or phloem xylem rays These are shorter in 
radial direction According to xylem type we distinguish between homoxylic 
and heteroxylic woods angiospermous Wood structure in homoxylic is simpler 
there is no division between conductive and specialized cells with 
functions Both conductive and mechanical functions are controlled by tracheids 
prosenchyma cells without cell wall perforations Water dilutions pass from 
tracheid to an above one through border pits on the 
walls Parenchyma is mainly found in rays of various width 
height Annual ring boundaries specifically latewood with thick lignified tracheids 
little diameter build barrier from freeze fungi or insects damage 
essential protective system is three dimensional net of resin canals 
in wood vertically and in pith rays horizontally The heteroxylic 
angiospermous deciduous trees contain special conductive cells vessels but tracheids 
also present Vessels are columns of dead tubular cells with 
transverse cell walls and longitudinal walls with pits and thickenings 
In case of ring porose species early vessels have large 
up to mm and high sap flow over in lianas 
are often found under great negative pressure which occurs when 
evaporation from leaves is faster than the root uptake of 
from the soil In this case they are sensitive to 
disorders due to the penetration of air air seeding into 
vessel embolism or penetration of xylem parenchyma from the neighbourhood 
spreads in the vessels interior fills the vessel in and 
rise to thyloses Xylem fibres libriform fibres are responsible for 
mechanical resistance of wood They are thin long usually dead 
with thick lignified walls It is mainly parenchyma that is 
for the storage function There are two type of parenchyma 
parallel to the longitudinal axis of an organ and usually 
vessels and horizontal parenchyma of pith rays Fig Vascular bundle 
composed of xylem left and phloem right Both parts are 
on the cross and radial section Sieve tube development is 
Phellogen Together with the cambium activity and every new growth 
xylem phloem and parenchyma of rays the plant diameter extend 
develop pressure on the outer layers of cells in the 
direction This results in the formation of another lateral secondary 
phellogen which might be located bellow epidermis in primary cork 
in pericycle in gymnospermous species Double sided dividing of daughter 
is typical of the phellogen The inner daughter cells live 
and form so called phelloderm The outer daughter cells store 
in the cell walls and as they become cork water 
gas resistant they gradually die They function as dead tissue 
phellem that protects the inner parts of tree from the 
danger The layer of phellem phellogen and phelloderm is considered 
cork Though such system of surface tissues in not permeable 
elements must be formed to let oxygen pass to life 
cells cambium phellogen and life phloem xylem and ray parenchyma 
in the secondary cork or even closer These elements are 
lenticels Fig They are tiny they have rounded or line 
cracks in the bark of trunks or branches or in 
epidermis of green stems spindle tree or epidermis of fruits 
originate by quick dividing of parenchyma cells by the phellogen 
towards the outer parts of stems The tissues with rich 
spaces aerate neighbouring deeper tissues The lenticels are frequently formed 
xylem rays In pre winter period the lenticels get covered 
water and gas resistant cork cells thus protective closing layer 
made This layer only lasts till spring when it gets 
by the pressure of the newly produced cells Fig Lenticel 
section of Sambucus nigra shoot Faster production of phellem resulted 
epidermis rupture and lenticel formation The activity and lifetime of 
greatly varies from species to species In some species beech 
phellogen cells are able to grow in number by means 
anticline division The phellogen ring growth is influenced by trunk 
which is carried out by the activity of cambium Bark 
such trees is smooth In other instances phellogen cells are 
able to form anticlines and divide only by means of 
The phellogen gets crack and gradually dies out as result 
an increasing radial pressure by newly developed annual rings In 
primary cork tissues later on even in life phloem new 
is formed They give rise to new layers of periderm 
dead outer layers The repetition of dying and the formation 
new phellogen is unique complex where dead layers of primary 
meet layers of periderm and later on dead layers of 
meet deeper and deeper formed periderm This tertial complex of 
tissues is called rhytidome or bark When it is peeled 
the older non functional layers of phloem are peeled too 
could be macroscopically observed as coarse deeply cracked bark which 
according to species trunk base of old pines birches
following phellogens could occur in concentrated rings in such case 
bark is known as ring bark and peels in longitudinal 
cross stripes juniper cherry or the new phellogen is formed 
and deeper as smaller or bigger lamellas and bark peels 
as large scales plane trees or small scales spruce Fig 
According the activity and lifetime of phellogen great variability of 
are formed ring bark Juniperus sp scale bark Picea abies 
latent meristem is called pericycle It occurs at the edge 
the central cylinder and together with cambium it may participate 
the formation and growing of lateral roots or formation of 
buds or roots but it can also sclarify and make 
mechanical support of phloem Aristolochia durior Roots The origin of 
The oldest vascular plants used to be rootless Even these 
all vascular sporebearing plants only have lateral roots of the 
origin Typical roots can be only found in seed plants 
are developed already in the embryo stage radicula In gymnospermous 
dicotyledonous plants root growth during germination is direct continuation of 
Such root is called primary Majority of lateral roots on 
primary root are formed as late as the post embryonic 
The outcome is the formation of the allorhitic root system 
is divided in the primary root and lateral roots Later 
new roots may grow on old roots trunks or branches 
They are called adventitious roots In monocotyledonous plants there is 
root system large number of lateral roots are found even 
the embryonic stage and radicula dies out in early stages 
plant growth couple of solid roots are based on hypocotyl 
the root system is further extended by branching as well 
establishing further roots on hypocotyl and higher positioned stem nodes 
characteristics of root systems in trees Root is prevailingly an 
organ which is heterotrophic and nonsegmental Along with the development 
the above ground system the root system grows by means 
branching of the primary root Roots have radial symmetry and 
bipolar the first pole root apex is distal distant from 
mother root or stem the second pole root base proximal 
connected with the mother root and with the stem base 
polarity is retained even at injured roots and regenerating root 
roots more numerous and finer are formed at the distal 
and formation of adventitious shoot buds at proximal area Root 
depend on photosynthates esp on carbohydrates derive from the above 
photosynthesising organs leaves from primary sources or from cotyledons or 
from secondary sources Endogenous and irregular branching gives origin to 
multilevel root system Root branches are called lateral roots of 
primary secondary orders They are formed in an acropetal 
in other words the youngest branches are always nearest to 
apex tip This type of branching is called monopodial Fig 
branching lateral branches are more dominant than the primary root 
less common This branching pattern can be found in some 
with mykorrhizza Pinus Fig Fine roots on Norway spruce growing 
the aerated and nutrient rich soil layer Root branching is 
regular and rich with many active root tips Fig Fine 
of Norway spruce growing in the heavy and wet soil 
the depth Root branching is irregular mostly root are dying 
root are short with spare root tips Lateral branching of 
usually occurs in an endogenous way The lateral roots are 
inside the branching root from the latent meristem pericycle Cytoplasm 
accumulated at some places in pericycle cells and the cells 
to divide both in the radial and tangential directions The 
of lateral root is established Further on the root penetrates 
primary cork and rhizodermis to get to the surface The 
of lateral roots is not accidental If the branching pattern 
observed in detail it is clear that they are arranged 
longitudinal lines orthostichies Cross sections demonstrate that the position of 
roots is related to the position of xylem and phloem 
of the vascular bundle In some species lateral roots originate 
longitudinal lines opposite to the phloem parts but most common 
is between the phloem and xylem Root shortening removing the 
apical tips launches the branching In practice this is applied 
pricking off replanting small plants or cutting of seedling roots 
to support rich growth of the root system As well 
the above ground system the root system grows for the 
lifetime without limitations Roots grow in length primary growth and 
diameter secondary growth In case of an adult plant the 
of the root system remains more or less unchanged The 
of dying off old roots equals the ratio of formation 
the new ones the turnover is balanced It is similar 
what happens in the above ground structures treetop volume and 
total area of foliage remains unchanged The lifetime is influenced 
factors such as type of roots anchor long life elongated 
life fine short life wood species and other conditions both 
and exogenous Types of root systems of trees as widely 
in literary sources are generalised and regard individual species that 
in the optimal soil conditions These root system types include 
plate root system tap root system heart shaped root system 
the variability of the root systems is much higher than 
changeability of treetops which corresponds to the fact that the 
conditions are more heterogeneous and the shape or root systems 
during ontogenesis For instance superficial root system may be observed 
pine Pinus sylvestris or beech Fagus sylvatica if they occur 
swampy soil Moreover it is frequent that the roots develop 
Reaching of roots into the depth of up to meters 
be even found in compacted and unsuitable belowground conditions in 
of young trees Adult and old trees need to decrease 
of energy so they limit the diameter growth lower treetops 
gradually move the root structure up into the higher surface 
Root biomass makes up of about third to half of 
biomass of the whole tree depending on site The poorer 
soil is the higher the root biomass share on the 
tree biomass is The division of the root biomass into 
depths is really interesting Quercus family concentrates of the total 
mass up to the depth of metre and up to 
In case of conifers the cm surface level concentrates of 
root biomass Generally the surface horizon of about cm in 
sites is considered zone of intense rootage However in urban 
this depth needs to be greatly regulated even due to 
intense soil compaction Root functions The root as an integral 
of the plant organism holds the following functions anchoring the 
in the ground or adhering to the ground mechanical function 
new area by the root growing uptake of water and 
sources direct influence on the rhisosphere material flow and direct 
of conditions of the symbionts development disintegration of the rock 
protection from erosion It also aerates the soil and enriches 
with organic materials due to root turnover dying and replacing 
new ones Other essential functions involve the conductive function by 
water enriched with diluted mineral substances and gases the storage 
starch mineral nutrients water the function of specified metabolism esp 
and excretion and information function hormonal activity root as growth 
accumulation sing affects the production of photosynthates protective function and 
function root stools and the competitive function in view to 
organisms root grafts alelopathy it even has parasitical functions 
If some of the functions prevail the root inner structure 
well as the general shape may metamorphose Root zone activity 
growth Meristem zone of the root primary growth Roots grow 
length on the root tips due to the activity of 
initials of the apical meristem The initials of the rest 
demonstrate low dividing and metabolic activity New cells of the 
cap responsible for covering and protecting the root tip are 
on the distal surface of the rest centre At the 
the root cap cells are intensely divided then they demonstrate 
intense metabolism and gradually reach the edge of the root 
to peel off Cells in the central part of the 
cap contain cascade amyloplasts The change in their position tells 
about the direction of gravity The cap excretes polysaccharide mucus 
makes it easier for root to penetrate into the soil 
the meristem from an injury drought or from separation from 
particles It also controls the uptake of ions into the 
and supports the development of the microbial flora and mycorhizal 
Cells of the resting centre divide their own initials of 
apical meristem on the proximal surface By dividing periclines and 
the number of layers of root cells is increased as 
as the number of individual layers cells This zone cells 
have primary walls they are interconnected with plasmoderms and have 
development features weakly developed membrane structure does not allow for 
speed of respiration any differentiated xylem is absent There are 
main functions of these cells firstly cell dividing as precondition 
the elongation growth of the root and secondly secretion of 
enabling the penetration of root into the soil The elongation 
Cells divided from initials derivates undergo division as well as 
growth in the elongation zone The higher the number of 
that cells complete the shorter they become in the end 
vice versa Yet not all parts of the elongation zone 
at the same rate This leads to developing many more 
cells than vascular elements related to the length unit of 
The heterogeneity in cell division rate and derivates growth determines 
histological and functional root heterogeneity in the radial direction Water 
into vacuoles containing glucose and fructose is intensified vacuoles grow 
size and fuse into central vacuole During the expansion this 
develops pressure from the inside of cells on the cell 
Their structures get reorganized polysaccharides split new chains of cellulose 
well as other substances of cell walls are synthesised such 
hemicellulose pectines and even some proteins Not only the uptake 
water is increased in the elongation root zone but also 
uptake of nutrients part of whose gets accumulated and another 
gets utilized Cell elongation develops pressure in distal direction on 
as far as the root cap and in proximal direction 
differentiation zone cells with solid tissues It is this pressure 
the root cap that allows root tip to penetrate into 
particles At first roots grow through soil macropores diameter over 
in case of risen soil resistance compacted sandy soils with 
majority of pores below mm in diameter the secretion activity 
the root cap grows substantially The period of root elongation 
on concrete species and it mainly occurs in early spring 
the soil has gone over the frost and in late 
Daily growth of roots varies greatly it can be as 
as mm in Acer saccharum to as much as mm 
Robinia pseudoacacia It is clear that substantial role is played 
the physiological age of tree It is obvious that in 
newly planted trees the growth is much faster than in 
ones with well developed root system Differentiation zone process that 
begun in the meristem is finalized in the differentiation zone 
outcome of this process is shape and functional differentiation of 
and tissues On the root surface there is tissue called 
which is single cell layer with no cuticle or stomata 
cells are rather thick from the exterior tangential plane there 
mucus layer on the surface and cellulose layer from the 
The mucus is not secretion output as in the case 
calyptra but it is part of the wall It contains 
of negative ions and is enriched with microbial substances that 
important in an exchange of cations between soil colloids and 
root Rhizodermis has special capability of enlarging the surface by 
creation of root rhizins this takes place roughly at the 
distance from the apex as the first functional differentiated elements 
xylem Rhizin is responsible for uptake of nutrients and for 
support Such rhizin activity is not as usual and intense 
trees as in herbs the rhizins are shorter and sparser 
they have longer lifespam than in herbs It entirely lacks 
unfavourable soil conditions esp weak aeration or if root is 
with mycorhizal fungi which fully compensate the rhizin function Older 
cells and rhizins suberinize peel off and are usually replaced 
secondary cork Under the rhizodermis there is primary cork much 
in root compare to the central cylinder except for Vaccinium 
is single layer Primary cork of trees is made of 
often containing wide intracellular spaces aerenchym developed mainly in wetty 
conditions and lack of oxygen Exodermis is not formed in 
cases at all Besides the aeration function the primary cork 
also has the following functions storage function starch proteins lipids 
function accumulation of tannin mucus ether oil and crystals protective 
accumulation of toxic substances and detoxication of these in vacuoles 
and transport functions All these functions are partly held by 
fungi that live and develop in mesoderm lot of substances 
water nutrients and gases carbon dioxide or oxygen are transported 
the soil through these cells through the apoplast by diffusion 
permeable cell walls and intracellular areas and by the symplast 
life cell bodies Endodermis cell walls are suberinized and lignified 
the radial and transversal directions Casparian strips These strips prevent 
further transport through the apoplast so most transported matters have 
cross the barrier of semipermeable membranes plasmalems or tonoplast and 
the symplast The local suberination and lignification of cell walls 
only absent with permeable transfer cells located opposite xylem groups 
the central cylinder Roots that demonstrate secondary diameter growth retain 
and primary cork only temporarily they can be found in 
roots and the youngest parts The term central cylinder stands 
column of conductive tissues system inside the root on its 
bordered with pericycle In more primitive gymnosperms the pericycle has 
layers as whole or multiple layers may only be set 
opposite xylem and phloem groups The pericycle cells retain the 
to divide they take part in regeneration processes they are 
place of lateral roots and part of cambium sometimes even 
Their cell walls are penetrated with plasmoderms securing contact between 
from endodermis and parenchyma in the central cylinder The conductive 
in root is represented by complex radial vascular bundle whose 
parts of protoxylem and protophloem are arranged in rays Phloem 
xylem sections alternate Based on the number of phloem and 
groups bundles are categorized into monarch diarch and triarch gymnospermous 
dicotyledonous and polyarch monocotyledonous palm trees Monstera Nonetheless this rate 
vary even in just one individual such as the case 
Picea albies with diarch triarch bundles and monarch vascular radial 
in its short roots Nearest to the root tip mm 
are differentiated elements of phloem that take photosynthates and required 
the system Further away from the root tip in an 
where root starts to operate as an organ absorbing water 
nutrients there is xylem In Abies fast growing roots it 
located mm from the apex in Acer in inadequate conditions 
is only mm At first xylem and phloem groups are 
radially and their number is unstable Xylem is differentiated in 
direction exarch protoxylem elements are closer to the perimeter of 
central cylinder and towards the centre there are metaxylem elements 
there is usually no pith Conductive pathways of wood especially 
and tracheids act as dead elements Intense synthesis of cell 
substances cellulose hemicellulose and lignin is active in their protoplasts 
the elongation and differentiation After the construction of these is 
protoplasts disintegrate Substances released at the programmed death of these 
become part of the whole transpiration flow and enrich nutrition 
the above ground system Roots get branched behind the differentiation 
root primordia are initiated endogenously in pericycle Because of this 
do not have an effect on the structure of the 
system of the parent axis as they do in the 
of stem When growing they tear the outer tissues of 
root till the soil is reached Even roots with suberinized 
demonstrate relatively high uptake of matter at places of root 
Root branching multiplies the number of root tips allows for 
density of rootage and more intense utilization of suitable soil 
Apical distal parts of roots are the most active parts 
terms of synthetic activity impact on rhizosphere water and nutrients 
from the soil Secondary growth and root functions Roots of 
grow into the depth by means of two types of 
meristems We can think of them as single layer shells 
concentric cylinders In the case of gymnosperms and dicotyledons cambium 
initiated in the central cylinder proximally from the apex The 
primary parenchyma cells that undergo the remeristemation are located at 
inner side of the primary phloem then on the boundary 
phloem and xylem groups and after that in the pericycle 
at outer sides of primary xylem groups Cross sections show 
the layer of cambial cells could be oval diarch roots 
triarch roots and so on in their early stages Ensuing 
the fact that cambium cells gradually divide mother cells of 
xylem centripetally mother cells of secondary phloem centrifugally and cells 
secondary phloem xylem rays between bundles in both directions cambium 
becomes of circular shape on the cross section Fig Fig 
section of Norway spruce fine roots Vascular bundle was radial 
at the early stage of fine root development Primary xylem 
and metaxylem secondary xylem first grow ring resin ducts secondary 
second grow ring secondary phloem pericycle primary cork Cambium in 
is active at different time in year than cambium in 
above ground systems Cambium may demonstrate different activity even among 
in one individual The same may happen even within one 
in one root part it may be more active than 
others This is mainly due to mineral components present in 
soil Root diameter increase in heavy and sandy rocky soils 
irregular most roots incline to develop eccentric structures which further 
their conductivity Annual rings in roots are thinner than in 
they are hardly visible and typical clear layer of early 
is missing in the ring porose ones The proportion of 
elements of xylem in roots rather differs from the ones 
stems and branches The secondary xylem in roots can be 
by intense development of conductive pathways vessels and tracheids and 
higher content of parenchyma This allows for easier transport and 
and it supports the active participation of roots in the 
of material exchange The number of xylem fibres is reduced 
for the ones in anchor roots and the ones with 
mechanical requirements In general cells in roots are bigger than 
stems and trunks in tangential and radial direction as well 
in length Phloem conductive pathways remain active or dormant in 
but they usually degenerate as early as the end of 
first growing season In spring new phloem elements differentiate from 
of cambial initials having overcome winter in an imperfect state 
with diameter increase of secondary roots another secondary meristem called 
is formed It is made by the remeristemation of pericycle 
Secondary meristems and their derivates could react to changes in 
root environment For instance if aeration is reduced abnormal xylem 
phloem with an increased content of parenchyma are formed transport 
carbonhydrates is inhibited absorption of macrobiotic nutrients is reduced root 
is limited For example hypertrophied lenticels are formed and the 
of adventitious roots is supported in some species Salix alba 
though the secondary root structure may considerably limit the intensity 
nutrient uptake from the soil the total uptake is not 
compared to the activity of root tips Although secondary roots 
suberinized surfaces this surfaces have fewer thinner and more permeable 
than in the above ground system Moreover they are connected 
the conductive system through phloem xylem rays Other locations with 
intense exchange with the soil include disturbed areas of suberinized 
near lateral roots initiations Regarding that the total surface of 
roots is very large the uptake of soil solutions through 
structure could not be omitted If roots are uncovered and 
to air for long time their bark or rhytidome resemble 
of trunk both in the visual and functional aspects Such 
lose the uptake ability and they mainly function is mechanical 
and conductivity Mycorrhiza The term mycorrhiza from Greek myc fungi 
root refers firstly to root symbiosis of higher plants with 
microscopic fungi secondly to organs formed during the symbiosis of 
plant root and an endophytic fungus The latter is mainly 
in ectomycorrhizae in which the association of root with mycorrhizal 
substantially affects morphological and anatomical root structure Mycorrhiza are the 
widespread symbioses that roots of plants create Foundations of plant 
fossils indicate that the predecessors of present fungi forming vesicular 
mycorrhiza lived in the symbiosis with plant roots as early 
their expansion from water to land environment which dates back 
approx million years from the Ordovician to the Carboniferous periods 
mycorrhizal types are younger and more derived One of typical 
of mycorrhiza is that their development in roots of host 
is only limited to the primary cork of roots Mycorrhizal 
never appear in the central cylinder Another distinctive feature of 
types of mycorrhiza is formation of network of mycelium in 
not in roots This extramatrical mycelium functioning mainly as satellite 
plant root system substantially enlarges soil volume as source of 
esp phosphate ions to the plant Based on the latest 
dedicated to mycorrhizal symbiosis the following basic types of mycorrhizae 
distinguished orchideoid ericoid arbutoid and monotropoid The older categorization into 
and ectomycorrhizal symbiosis related to the capability of mycorrhizal fungi 
colonise cells of primary cork Only the endomycorrhizal are able 
do this The development of an endophytic fungus in ectomycorrhizae 
limited to intracellular spaces in primary cork In this aspect 
arbutoid and monotropoid mycorrhizae are transitional type fungus colonises primary 
cells but these mycorrhizae have some common features with ectomycorrhiza 
following text desrcibes only the types of vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 
and ectendomycorrhizae as these are the ones that play the 
important part in woody species Vesicular arbuscular mycorrhiza arbuscular 
includes really wide spectrum of species of host 
it is estimated that about of all plant species form 
kind of mycorrhiza In this view it is the most 
symbiosis in the world It can be found in plant 
through all climatic zones and environmental conditions no matter if 
occur with trees bushes or herbs Typical woody species that 
are from Cupressaceae and Taxaceae families also occurs 
seedlings of Pinaceae family though this family usually forms ectomycorrzhizae 
species specific symbiosis has been documented yet so it 
generally presumed that there is no such specialization In different 
there has been an evidence of certain kind of environmental 
It lies in the preference of certain fungi species by 
plant species in the same environmental conditions Typical structures of 
type of mycorrhiza are arbuscules alternatively vesicles whose presence makes 
background for the most widely accepted definition Arbuscules are formed 
cells of root primary cork They could be characterized by 
multiple fork like branching and finalized growth Arbuscule cell wall 
thinned or absent The plasmatic membrane of fungus is never 
direct contact with cytoplasm of cork cell Arbuscules are considered 
be the centre of symbiotic transmission of phosphates and carbohydrates 
fungus and plant Vesicles are located either inside root primary 
cells or in intracellular spaces They have storage function containing 
lipids Ectomycorrhiza In comparison to host plants the 
of host plants is very small it only makes 
about of species of all plants Yet this is an 
significant type of symbiosis in our tree species as it 
within families Pinaceae especially Pinus and Picea and Fagaceae Fagus 
Quercus Another important families with are Myrtaceae in subtropical 
temperate climates in the southern hemisphere and Dipterocarpaceae in the 
forests in the South East Asia Even other species of 
families form Betulaceae Some species can either form
depending on soil conditions of the site Such families 
Eucalyptus Salix or Populus is formed in conditions of 
humid soils Compared to when the creation of mycorrhizal 
does not affect morphology of an infected root the formation 
symbiosis leads to substantial changes in the structure of 
tips only these are capable of formation Their apical 
finalizes its growth so root is shorter and thicker The 
of the shortening and thickening processes depends on the development 
of root tip at the moment of its contact with 
fungus Another typical feature is forky root branching An ectomycorrhizal 
has several fold longer lifetime approx months than non mycorrhizal 
tips The following structural components are typical for ectomycorrhiza Fungi 
it covers root surface It may only be weakly developed 
absent Typically the biomass of fungus mantle makes up of 
of the total biomass of short root Hartig net 
of hyphen growing from fungus mantle into the rhizodermis and 
spaces of root primary cork It is typical for these 
to be branching intensely Spreading of hyphen may be only 
to rhizodermis typical for angiosperms or they may grow in 
spaces of more layers of the primary cork they sometimes 
grow through all layers of the primary cork typical for 
Hartig net is place of the most intense material exchange 
associated symbiotic organisms Extramatrical mycelium serves to absorb nutrients It 
be aggregated into rhizomorphs thick strands of hyphen that are 
visible Rhizomorphs serve to transport material on long distances Older 
regarded fungus mantle as centre of uptake of nutrients from 
soil Nonetheless at present the extramatrical mycelium is considered to 
an essential part in the absorption of mineral substances as 
the case of other types of mycorrhizae The Hartig net 
place where minerals absorbed from the soil are exchanged for 
assimilated by plant in the photosynthesis Ectomycorrhiza is mainly formed 
the soils rich in organic substances especially surface horizons of 
soils substantial portion of phosphates and other nitrogens in these 
may exist as organic compounds fungi are able to 
these organic compounds by means of hydrolytic enzymes and perhaps 
due to associated bacteria Acceptable mineral forms of nutrients for 
are formed Ectendomycorrhiza Although ectendomycorrhizae are quite widespread we do 
have much reliable information on them They could be formed 
woods that commonly form symbiosis with especially in the 
ontogenetic stages described in Pinus Larix Picea Some fungus taxons 
active ectendomycorrhiza are related to fungi as well since 
may form typical depending on host plant All aspects 
development and formation of typical structures are comparable to 
for the intercellular penetration of primary cork cells of host 
Both fungus mantle and Hartig net are created And at 
same time hyphen grow through primary cork cells where they 
intensely branched This symbiotic association is very stable and similarly 
in roots do not demonstrate any traces of senescence 
of root In the course of evolution root functions have 
considerably in many instances This concerns all types of roots 
lateral or adventitious Along with the change in function the 
and inner structure have changed too Root metamorphoses may be 
enormous that the original character of this belowground structure has 
completely away Many adventitious roots of species located in loose 
muddy soils fulfil mechanic functions It is as if plants 
standing on stilts that is why these roots are called 
roots The same function is also taken by so called 
roots that support giant trees of many tropical species and 
roots developed in some species in tropical rainforests Many lianas 
Ivy Hedera and numerous epiphytical species are fixed by adventitious 
The fixation function is also made by adventitious roots formed 
stems of creeping species Cotoneaster Salix Pinus mugo and the 
plant uses them to be tied to the soil and 
the same time to take in nutrients They can even 
separated by means of the vegetative reproduction an form polycormons 
spines on palm trunks originate from root Aerial roots commonly 
with epiphytes They grow freely in the air and their 
cells of multilayer rhizodermis absorb water from the rainfall Such 
may also have the assimilation function Species that live in 
areas with lack of air have breathing roots pneumatophores that 
an exchange of gases They grow right up in the 
their tips stick out of the soil or water Taxodium 
Parasite roots haustoria are special case of metamorphoses Some lateral 
develop as tiny tubers Haustoria meaning organs that draw nutrients 
host plant grow from the tubers and penetrate as far 
vascular bundles of host Viscum Loranthus Limiting factors of root 
growth and functions Firstly these are the factors that reduce 
positive carbon balance in the above ground system balance between 
photosynthesis and respiration or negatively impact the translocation of photosynthates 
growth hormones in different manner radiation stress temperature stress water 
intoxication injury stress by an intentional cut or by the 
snow frost oxidation stress by increased entry of oxide substances 
as damage to conductive pathways and 
by frost and bark scarlatina of unshaded trunks by fungi 
insects and range of other negative factors including the ones 
are connected with various defoliations Other important factors include soil 
especially the soil type into which roots penetrate and regenerate 
it is high content of skeleton rocks stones remainders of 
and the mechanical impedance of soil that limits the 
penetration The soil in urban areas is commonly compacted by 
driving of heavy machines and flooded as water from rains 
easily get absorbed If soil aeration is limited hypoxia this 
to higher production of potentially toxic materials to the modification 
shoot growth inhibition of formation and growth of leaves When 
affecting is long term the diameter growth of adult trees 
down and the phloem and xylem anatomy gets transformed In 
cases the absorption of minerals is limited due to smaller 
of the root system and lack of energy This is 
of the fact that in the anaerobic respiration of an 
substrate less energy is released than is required to cover 
needs of complex root functions Not only the soil drought 
also hypoxia may stop the uptake of nutrients and it 
even happen that ions are released from the roots out 
the soil The soil drought results into worsened uptake of 
by the roots transpiration and assimilation limitation worse cooling of 
supply of leaves with nutrients and roots with photosynthates Moreover 
results into the efflux of nutrients in fine roots and 
the limited contact of roots with the rhizosphere and may 
in death of roots The soil drought together with unfavourable 
conditions such as low relative humidity high temperature or wind 
the ones that lead to an increased evaporation might bring 
damage to the conductive pathways in xylem by high negative 
This may cause breaking of water columns and consequent suction 
air or cells from the neighbouring parenchyma into the vessels 
roots mortality may also rise due to high content of 
in the soil due to an imbalanced uptake between individual 
low recoverability of nutrients and an absence of mycorrhizae winter 
summer temperature thermal convection of asphalt surfaces thermal radiation of 
One of ways of sustaining trees in towns is 
secure them conditions needed for their well being This means 
make range of tasks namely to secure long term good 
and volume of the belowground and air space and to 
secure their requirements for water regime irrigation evaporation temperature regime 
in groups and light regime to respect demands on density 
quality of radiation length of day and growing season sum 
radiation in growing season and in calendar year and to 
manage natural soil processes mainly the recoverability of nutrients and 
presence of suitable soil flora and fauna In confined urban 
such as pedestrian zones or stations of public transport
are often placed into special containers on the ground level 
with decorative lattices serving as prevention from the soil compaction 
walking These lattices should be made of modules dismountable in 
radial direction in case of round container as well as 
tangential direction links between partial circles Such treatment is especially 
by the base part of trunk since the volume changes 
the diameter growth are really great at this place The 
is true for volume changes in the root system due 
the elongation growth The base part of trunk may quite 
reach considerable volume changes at the places of connections of 
with trunk which are of high importance for the mechanical 
of tree The ground level containers have the following disadvantages 
entry of salt water from melting snow and ice removed 
roads The salt solution in winter has much lower temperature 
the soil which means that it may promptly and repetitively 
to freezing out of fine roots In the urban zones 
are also held in above ground containers placed on the 
of streets They have these great advantages the soil is 
from dirty salt water and from being walked on On 
other hand the soil is not protected from the frost 
the beginning and end of the growing season or from 
and drying in summer The stem The stem caulom is 
usually above ground structure with nodes It generates differentiates and 
lateral branches leaves flowers and fruits The stem mediates their 
with the roots by distribution of water nutrients photosynthates and 
electric and stress information signals It participates in photosynthesis 
and protection its directed growth occupies the optimal space and 
is storage of water and starch for overcoming bad periods 
elongation growth generation of leaves and lateral branches is made 
the apex meristems The connection of these new modules to 
roots is secured by the cambium significant role of stem 
also to maintain spare suppressed buds that can renew growth 
heavy stress after an injury by wind lightning browsing frost 
starvation Some other important roles include vegetative reproduction or 
plant on the spot Internodes of stem are sections between 
nodes which are base of leaves and buds The length 
internodes corresponds to the biological type of plant longest in 
shortest in gymnosperms on shortened shoots holding bundles of needles 
to the age and position in tree crown quickly growing 
after deep reduction of tree crown compared to edge parts 
crowns of old trees environmental condition shaded stems demonstrate lower 
of internodes than stems in the direct sunlight tree stem 
leaves is called shoot An unbranched part connecting the root 
the tree crown is known as trunk stems within the 
are called branches Trunks usually have the radial symmetry the 
frequent shape is cylindrical but may also be muscular flattened 
At the bottom it is extended by roots By the 
of growth and self bearing capacity stems are categorized into 
groups direct heliotropic grow up vertically plagiotropic grow horizontally bent 
older and grow down overhanging pendular ascending lying creeping cotoneasters 
blackberries Trunks are among the greatest organs in the 
kingdom Palm Calamus leaf climbers might reach as high as 
The tallest trees reach up to metres These are Australian 
which are even taller that sequoia Sequoiadendron giganteum reaching The 
circumstance has Mexican Cypress Taxodium mexicanum With the diameter of 
wins over North American sequoias Nonetheless sequoias still hold the 
record as the largest organisms by volume The stem structure 
made of covering tissues primary tissues conductive tissues differentiated from 
apex meristems In this case the epidermis on the surface 
single layer sometimes with well developed stomata it has commonly 
and trichomes In multi layer epidermis tissue layers below the 
are called the hypodermis The primary cork lies under the 
and consists of two to three layers upper layer of 
cork has mechanical function It contains collenchyma commonly with chloroplasts 
young stems it quickly loses its tension turgor when water 
absent The medium layer is usually parenchyma with the assimilation 
The lowest layer is made of living cells of endodermis 
its cells of another kind such as starch stripes but 
could be also absent The primary cork has mechanical storage 
and protective functions Closer to the centre there is central 
On its periphery there is pericycle latent secret meristem where 
roots and buds may originate below there is system of 
tissues vascular bundles There are two types of vascular bundles 
stem of gymnosperms dicots and monocots Fig The first lead 
the stem to leaves the other run through the stem 
In monocots all vascular bundles are leaf traces In case 
conifers and angiosperms the vascular bundles are collateral arranged in 
On the cross section they create circle surrounded by the 
cork at the outer side and by pith at the 
side Pith is connected with primary cork by stripes of 
tissues pith rays Fig Vascular bundles arrangement in gymnosperm and 
left and monocots right Stem pith fills the centre It 
thin walled cells most commonly freely connected cell wall is 
weakly lignified Intercellular space in pith are filled with air 
water Pith of some trees quickly breaks Juglans Vitis vinifera 
new cavities are formed which are interrupted by partitions While 
some species pith is sustained for long time and functions

gradually develop secondary structure depending on the formation and activity 
secondary meristems Fig These include cambium which replaces the systems 
conductive tissues divided into phloem and xylem sections of vascular 
and the systems of primary tissues with phloem xylem rays 
resin canals in gymnosperms such as spruce or pine We 
between two types of cambial initials in woody plants Cambial 
are named fascicular cambium form xylem and phloem The second 
interfascicular cambium form pith rays is usually formed at the 
of the first year Fascicular and interfascicular cambium together make 
cylinder on the cross section Another secondary meristem is phellogen 
generates secondary covering tissues secondary bark Fig Cross section of 
year old Norway spruce shoot pith primary xylem secondary xylem 
phloem pericycle with resin ducts primary cork resin duct Development 
annual rings Cambium activity depends on the activity of meristem 
of the stem apex lateral buds signals from leaf roots 
suppressed buds It begins in spring by first dividing and 
of phloem and xylem mother cells that were formed in 
previous autumn and survived winter Cambial initials take water into 
their thick cytoplasm is pushed by the growing vacuoles to 
wall which is extending and becoming thinner in the radial 
This action begins below buds due to the phytohormonal factors 
gibberellins cytokinins with coworking of carbohydrates In the case of 
diffuse porous woody plants this activity directs from stem tips 
the trunk base If ring porous woody plants are considered 
process begins later but is faster and as early as 
first buds begin growing the first vessels are functional Regarding 
the impulse comes from old as well as new needles 
of cambial initials begins couple of weeks later the division 
all over the trunk and the process ends in the 
system The same process applies for closing of cambial activity 
autumn and this is why roots grow even in autumn 
first cells produced by cambium in spring are xylem mother 
phloem cells follow In this period xylem cells grow really 
and their cells have larger lumen and thinner walls Such 
is important for its conductive function In summer the situation 
reverse Cambium activity slows down and latewood cells are thick 
they have mechanical and defence functions So this is how 
and late wood originate its annual growth is known as 
annual ring Fig However there are cases when more than 
annual ring may be formed in year Such false rings 
from defoliation of tree by insects interruption of the growth 
by drought and due to other unfavourable factors The activity 
phloem formation is weak in spring but it sharply rises 
the course of the growing season and continues till autumn 
spring the cambial zone is thick cells of initials with 
cells of conductive and primary tissues in autumn it is 
on the contrary Cambium activity in young trees starts earlier 
spring and finishes later in autumn than in the case 
old or weak trees Fig Cross section of years old 
spruce branch Annual ring is formed by earlywood conductive function 
latewood mechanical and protection function Wood of coniferous species It 
an evolutionary older type It can be characterised by simple 
typical alternation of early and late tracheids and parenchyma cells 
These elements build the structure of annual rings The main 
of wood is tracheid that makes up about of volume 
coniferous wood Conductive function of early tracheids reflects their shape 
walled prosenchymatic cells length mm and diameter mm wall thickness 
flows through border pits in the cell wall which is 
coniferous wood is quite resistant to water flow Water is 
supplied due to an increased rate of early tracheids trees 
good years form more early wood than late wood The 
the annual ring is the more early tracheids are produced 
tracheids fulfil the conductive function longer than vessels of deciduous 
and larger part of wood is active in water transport 
annual rings Late tracheids are thickwalled sclerenchyma cells They are 
longer than early tracheids and cell wall is wide Another 
types are parenchyma cells These are thin walled isodiametric cells 
play role in the formation of resin canals and pith 
They fulfil secretion functions secure radial transport of water and 
they fulfil also mechanical functions Fig Coniferous wood structure Picea 
Wood of deciduous species The wood of deciduous plants is 
younger than the wood of conifers This is reflected in 
complexity of the structure higher assortment of cell types which 
more specialized on certain functions Deciduous wood is made of 
tracheids fibre vasicentric tracheidal libriform fibres and parenchyma cells Fig 
are specialized conductive elements made of vessel elements They may 
considerable lengths for oak for birch The most common length 
mm Taking into account their considerably thin cell walls vessels 
not have high mechanical stability Therefore they are reinforced with 
or round thickening Depending on species the rate of vessels 
the overall wood volume varies from maple to Populus Fagus 
There are three types of deciduous tracheids tracheidal vasicentric and 
The first ones mainly fulfil conductive function and do not 
with the majority of deciduous trees Vasicentric tracheids also have 
function but only appear in company with vessels such as 
Fibrous tracheids are cells with mechanical function but they can 
fulfil conductive and storage functions Libriform fibres are mechanical elements 
wood of deciduous trees Their percentage representation ranges from Fagus 
to Acer These are thick walled short cylindrical or spindle 
Their shape and size make them really stable cells that 
secure the wood solidity Parenchyma cells in deciduous cells make 
about of wood volume They are tiny cells mostly isodiametric 
of roll shape Fig Structure of deciduous ring porous wood 
fluviatilis Stem morphology Trees have distinguished main stem trunk It 
not branch and usually bears lateral branches and leaves Skeleton 
branches of the first class bear macroblasts branches of the 
and higher classes Shoots with shortened internodes are called brachyblasts 
some species they are formed regularly Ginkgo Larix but in 
species only as modification which allows for the annual generation 
new leaves flowers and fruits without extreme growing of crown 
Fagus Malus All branches make crown It gives trees their 
appearance habitus depending on means of branching number of branches 
of branches foliation Monocotyledons have enclosed vascular bundles they 
scattered and all of them pass from stem to leaves 
is no boundary between the primary bark and the central 
there is no pith or rhytidome Secondary thickening is rare 
not exist in palm bamboo It is carried out through 
initials centrifuginal dividing of primary parenchyma tissue gradually sclerifying and 
vascular bundles The phellogen is formed on the outer side 
cork with an occasional occurrence of parenchyma and sclerenchyma cells 
dracaena yucca Branching of tree stems is holoblastic apex tip 
not split it remains as whole complex There are two 
Monopodial racemose The main apex is the tallest lateral branches 
shorter It is thicker and its individual modules are derived 
the original apex tip Sympodial branching The main apex is 
shortest and lateral branches are taller Sympodium is further classified 
monochasium formed in woody species with alternate leaves and node 
At the end of the growing season the apex growth 
down and the tip bud either remains under developed or 
not survive winter In late summer or the following spring 
nearest lateral bud gets into the position of the terminal 
gives rise to new main shoot By growth of lateral 
of higher and higher classes branch elongates Tilia Betula Populus 
is also developed in wine Vitis vinifera whose apex bud 
into shoot lateral bud based in leaf node overtakes its 
position dichasium is typical of woody species with an opposite 
of leaves and node buds Even in this case the 
stem weakens as time passes or the terminal bud differentiates 
flower Then it shoots and there arise two almost equal 
of both opposite buds Syringa Acer Aesculus Monopodial woody plants 
retain this exact type of branching in their lifetime they 
pass to the other branching pattern There are lot of 
leading to this change like injury parasites inadequate functioning of 
root system drought or age of an individual Monopodium remains 
main type of branching for long time for instance in 
with conical crown Yet its branches incline to sympodium Similarly 
in young pine trees is monopodial but old pines crowns 
not monopodial which reflects in bizarre shapes of crowns The 
branching especially dichasium forms rounded and oval tree crowns or 
and conoid crowns The shape of crown is more plastical 
can better capture the sunlight and prevent from evaporation On 
other hand if dichasium branching develops too soon two main 
branches may develop in the crown whose phototropic growth towards 
sunlight drives them apart and this may end in huge 
due to the opposite forces of two large heavy branches 
tree crown its size and shape are defined by the 
and age of tree differences in rate of growth of 
and lateral branches and type or branching However even sunlight 
crowns and individuals in related greenery unidirectional dry wind flag 
crowns and low soil humidity umbrella crowns play significant part 
the final crown shape Fig Stem branching pattern and tree 
shrub growth Monopodial the main apex is the tallest lateral 
are shorter Sympodial branching the main apex is the shortest 
lateral branches are taller Acrotony growth form of tree Basitony 
form of shrubs The arrangement of leaves on the stem 
is defined by plant species In the opposite pattern leaves 
in pairs facing each other turned of from the lower 
Acer Aesculus If more than two leaves grow from node 
pattern is called whorled Catalpa The position in more or 
loose screws is called alternate or spiral In this case 
of the leaves are positioned in vertical lines orthostichies If 
want to get from given leaf to the nearest in 
same orthostichy we need to go round the stem several 
and pass leaves of other orthostichies The number of round 
leaves defines the type of leaf pattern Distichal meaning two 
in one round the third leaf in the same line 
the first is typical in shaded branches such as in 
elm lime and monocots Dicots bear leaves in the pattern 
also If the arrangement of leaves is modified by 
light reaction change of spacial arrangement as result of leaf 
it is necessary to study the position of leaves in 
to be able to define the type of phyllotaxis The 
of stem pith relates to phyllotaxis Bud The bud is 
foundation of future structure shoot leaf flower It consists of 
tip meristems leaf primordia in the acropetal order and axil 
The oldest leaves sometimes metamorphed into scales protect bud Buds 
the tip of stems branches are called terminal buds This 
the leading apex bud of the main stem or trunk 
in the axils of leaves in stem nodes are axillary 
buds The vertical arrangement of these is called serial Lonicera 
is called collateral Prunus spinosa Apex and lateral buds regular 
in trees flowering prior to foliating may be subdivided into 
buds bearing the base of shortened stem and leaves modified 
flower parts and leaf buds bearing the base of shoot 
buds are mixed giving rise to shoots first and flowers 
Tilia The classification by the inner differentiation defines buds of 
fir and poplar type Regarding the fir type buds the 
shoot foundations were based year prior to spring when they 
growing in volume Considering the poplar type new shoots develop 
to climatic conditions in the same year of shooting and 
there is no significant role of the previous year The 
that are passive only for one resting period and start 
the following spring are called winter buds The ones that 
passive are called dormant buds If these grow and branch 
still do not reach the surface of the bark are 
suppressed buds This type enables the reproduction and regeneration of 
plant when its integrity is violated perhaps by the frost 
weak functioning of conductive tissues age The same function 
held by the adventitious buds formed beside the regular order 
the internodes nodes of stem or roots These reserve buds 
commonly called preventive buds The inner structure as well as 
outer appearance could be considerably modified or metamorphed from the 
described models if stem takes over other functions such as 
function prickles Some species have prickles only in young individuals 
root sprouts or low branches while they are absent in 
The climatic conditions play part too in blackthorn these structures 
develop on dry and warm sites while in humid conditions 
greenhouse they do not develop at all This is due 
the fact that in this case thorns are protection 
herbivore animals Assimilation green stems have Cytisus and stems of 
serve as reservoirs of water Stems also secure vegetative reproduction 
branches are in contact with the soil they might give 
to adventitious roots Fagus Picea aj which could later develop 
individual plants Fig Leaves and axillary buds are formed in 
first year Terminal buds are formed when shoot elongation growth 
Conifers form axillary buds only at the base of few 
Leaf Leaf phylum is lateral structure generated by the stem 
has pre defined position limited growth and age leaf fulfils 
functions photosynthetic reception of solar radiation and release of 
transpiration conductive evaporation cooling control of cell tension turgor supply 
leaf with nutrients and conduct of photosynthates away and respiratory 
and renewal of precursors for syntheses chlorophyll Other significant functions 
reproductive type of leaves called sporophylls microsporophylls and megasporophylls and 
phylloms and regulation functions phytohormones production The most frequent typical 
is modified in order to optimally work at material exchange 
the environment and this is why its exterior as well 
interior surface is large Besides leaves can take over other 
different functions which makes their structure completely modified defence function 
the modification into spines Leaves are the most variable organ 
an individual which ensues from its numerous functions and necessity 
structurally react to different environments in tree crown light wind 
humidity temperature gradients If leaf completely changes its appearance and 
not as result of the photosynthetic function we call this 
metamorphosis If it only reacts by slight deviations in the 
or shape to exogenous impulses in order to optimally fulfil 
function it is called modification Phyllogenesis the evolution of leaf 
of vascular plants originated in set of terminal plant body 
sterile telomes of psilophyton plants Telomes used to planate flatten 
and develop in two directions This is how large flat 
leaves called macrophyll of present ferns and angiosperms were formed 
needle or scaly leaves of angiosperms and meiophylls thin single 
leaves of horsetails is thought to have originated by the 
and condensation of macrophylls or their elements flat leaf found 
Ginkgo biloba among angiosperms evolved from grafted needles Broad leaves 
Japanese umbrella pine Sciadopitys verticillata evolved the same way Ontogenesis 
individual development of leaf leaf develops on the apex tip 
leaf primordium Further on an axil bud develops in its 
scattered in angiosperms regular in dicots Buds of some woody 
early flowering Acer Forsythia Magnolia divided by their origination into 
buds bearing leaf elements and flower buds bearing flower elements 
in other species are mixed first leaves grow followed by 
inflorescence Tilia on the tip of the shoot In the 
climate of Central Europe buds of nearly all woods are 
by covering scales Naked buds without covering scales can be 
in Frangula and Viburnum lantana semi naked buds covered only 
the bottom side can be found in elderry bush Sambucus 
Submerged buds covered only at the bottom of leafstalk are 
for Platanus Scales that cover buds are formed in various 
opposite double line spiral sloping they are either bald or 
hairy feltlike or veined Aesculus The placing of leaf in 
prior to its opening is called the vernation Woods may 
flat vernation front sides of leaves are one on top 
another Viscum or compound if young leaves are folded in 
each covered with the previous one Prunus cirrus where the 
is folded in cirrus matter along the main vessels Fagus 
or coiled under or above Besides the vernation estivation is 
too Estivation is the relation between leaves in single bud 
can touch each other be lied one on anther
on the stem develop acropetally from the stem base with 
oldest leaves towards the apex with the youngest leaves The 
between the origination of one leaf and the origination of 
next is known as plastochron Regarding the evolutionarily older plants 
as turf cycas leaf grows by dividing of apex meristems 
means that the apex part is the youngest spiral leaf 
is oldest develops first The opposite process applies to conifers 
gymnosperms whose leaves grow by dividing of basal meristems the 
parts are leaf tips In spring leaf tips get damaged 
late frost or salty solutions from urban and road salt 
In autumn leaf tips and edges are the first to 
and die budding and growing leaf is dependent on ready 
photosynthates it becomes autotrophic only after maturing about two thirds 
its final weight Considering deciduous trees low positioned buds on 
base of crown grow first in spring and buds on 
crown top open last There is the opposite process in 
It corresponds to the intensity of the upward pressure in 
which is very low in conifers Opening of buds is 
by temperature and lengthening of the daytime In lower altitudes 
on warmer slopes woods of the same species open buds 
than in the mountains or on northern slopes Temperature is 
important and is valued as sum of effective temperatures Lower 
requirements can be seen with mountain ecotypes of homoxylic or 
porose wood types Round porose for instance ash tree prevent 
late frost by later bud development Lifetime and time of 
functional capacity of leaves depends on species and the environment 
case of deciduous trees with falling leaves leaves are functional 
one growing season in case of evergreen deciduous they persist 
two or more years Hedera Lonicera Conifers may bear needles 
years Pinus silvestris up to as many as years Pinus 
In general lifetime of foliage is shortened due to inadequate 
that are either permanent such as compacted soil frequent or 
such as fluctuation in humidity temperature Leaves on the 
crowns margin change colour first while basal and interior more 
leaves grow old later even though they develop buds earlier 
of leaves slow down by night light This means that 
length of growing season defined by the number of days 
favourable temperatures from spring to autumn within one crown may 
even month longer in the crown interior The autumn change 
colour of leaves is related to the disintegration of chlorophyll 
covering of chlorophyll by carotenoids yellow or orange leaves and 
purple leaves such as Parthenocissus inserta Changing of colour is 
controlled process during which the intensity of respiration rises energy 
substances but also mobile nutrients such as phosphor or potassium 
from leaves to storage tissues of stems branches or roots 
process mainly takes place at cold nights when day gets 
as it requires sufficient humidity The period of colour changes 
about two or three weeks At the beginning of winter 
of deciduous trees fall off This is how tree gets 
of waste matter of old non functional leaves The process 
controlled by growth inhibitors and can be active due to 
of parenchyma tissue of leafstalk base whose solidity is violated 
slimming of intracellular material or its freezing tearing or dying 
After tracheids are torn leaf falls off When leaf is 
new wound may be either covered by protective cork layer 
fallen foliage protects the soil from drying enables the nutrition 
soil organisms and it generally gives organic and mineral materials 
into the soil Though needles of some conifers and leaves 
some greenhorns Hedera helix change colour in autumn as well 
follow up fall off Their colour is affected by the 
in light intensity day length and lowering temperature Needles of 
and pine damaged by winter drought are redish their fall 
is delayed Insufficient nitrogen magnesium iron nutrition leads to 
of leaves and may be caused by the lack of 
in the soil or limited root activity We can sometimes 
that part of tree foliage is green and another part 
yellowish This may mean that conductive pathways of branch may 
mechanically by breaking or biotically fungi infection damaged Leaves on 
branch have worsened nutrition and water balance Brownish colour of 
may be caused by the replacement of the central atom 
chlorophyll magnesium by an atom of hydrogen in acid conditions 
vacuoles are damaged due to foliage decomposition or due to 
rain If there is critical lack of water trees plan 
decrease transpiration area by premature fall off of leaves The 
of leaves on stem spot where leaf touches the stem 
part of the node is called leaf insertion and after 
falls off this spot is called leaf scar In the 
scar you can observe leaf tracks spots after vascular bundles 
sometimes even pillows The shape and size of scar and 
character varied largely and become characteristics for discerning woody species 
the winter period Regarding the position on the stem there 
single leaves in spiral alternate or pairs of leaves on 
node opposite or whorled Shaded branches could have an alternate 
of leaves transforms into horizontally placed branches that are secondarily 
organized in one plane Tilia Fagus Picea We could distinguish 
by the angle between leaves and stem as upright angle 
than degerees and protruding to degrees The opposite position of 
pairs facing each other may be cross in two vertical 
orthogonal planes often on upright branches Even opposite leaves may 
into distichal More than two leaves may grow from one 
such as in Catalpa leaf occurs in plant in five 
cotyledon in embryo primary leaves in juvenile stage of plant 
sometimes with shapes deviated from typical trophophylls and assimilation leaves 
and In the flower part there are upper bracts bracteoles 
flower phylloms On the basis of shoot there are cataphyllas 
shift from bud bracts to assimilation leaves of growing shoot 
may be scaly tiny their axel buds are small undeveloped 
grow as spare primordia and they develop branch collar in 
branches Fig Germinated beech seedlings plotted above the soil surface 
leaves epigeic germination which become green chloroplast development and start 
Fig Germinated oak seedlings plotted above the soil surface leaves

stem growth The outer structure of assimilation leaves Assimilation leaves 
gymnospermous woods are made of blade lamina petiole and sheath 
of these parts may be absent or become stunted and 
roles may be taken over by stem Sarothamnus blade is 
part of leaf It is usually green but sometimes can 
stained with green yellow or white spots Some leaves can 
red due to antocyans Some decorative conifers have delayed generation 
chlorophylls and the light colour of young needles contrasts older 
ones Picea abies Argenteospicata blade bears typical characteristics of the 
shape of the outline edge and base type of outline 
venation simple blade is either undivided or subdivided by 
of various depths They are arranged in various patterns pinnately 
palmately lobed into or almost reaching the main vein or 
base If blade is completely divided into individual leaves the 
is compound pinnate odd pinnate even pinnate brake pinnate multi 
or palmate tripalmate or multipalmate In pinnately compound leaves 
main spindle or side spindles is held by yokes of 
leaves facing opposite The rate between the perimeter and area 
leaf blade is often higher in xerophytes than in sciophytes 
hygrophytes it is related to the resistance of the bordering 
of air above leaf that prevents from an excessive loss 
water The tolerance of leaves to solar radiation and dryness 
related to the consistence of leaf blade and its reduction 
are solid hard tough and resilient leaves Soft blades malacophyllas 
their resilience by trichomes succulent leaves increase their volume water 
tissue Leaf blades are mainly symmetric however in some woods 
Fagus Morus there is certain asymmetry grounded as early as 
the bud For instance in horizontal branches of elm the 
half of leaf towards the branch apex is larger than 
outer half blade extends at the bottom near the main 
An opposite asymmetry is typical for beech the largest is 
outer side of leaf The leaf heterogeneity means various behaviour 
features not only of its right and left halves but 
their marginal central apical and basal sections Shaded horizontally arranged 
have leaf mosaic Fig This means heterophylly different length and 
of petioles along with various sizes of leaf blades This 
utilizes the area and the leaves may optimally use the 
radiation There is also special case of heterophylly when plant 
differently formed assimilation leaves Fig An individual plant bears leaves 
the same category of different shapes lobate pinnate sterile leaves 
compound leaves bearing flower shoots Hedera helix Fig Leaf mosaic 
under low light condition by leaf blade and petiole length 
This arrangement enables maximal light capture Fig Heterophylly means that 
leave shapes could be found on the one individual sheath 
formed by an excessive development of base part of leaf 
is typical for monocotyledons dracenae banana tree calla Leaf 
grows around the stem above node as high as another 
so the stem is sometimes hidden Leaf sheaths may take 
in the mechanical stability of false trunks petiole is stem 
of leaf that connects leaf with stem Actually it originates 
bud but its growth is delayed compared to blade development 
leaves of the upright shoots often have longer petioles than 
upper leaves Acer petiole may turn leaf towards the optimal 
in case of needles spruce they are repositioned in bud 
spindle into the open position of crown top or distichal 
shade the length and angle of petioles are also utilized 
the formation of leaf mosaic Flattened petioles increase leaf mobility 
also helps increase water evaporation Populus tremula Sometimes the petiole 
in hood preventing bud during its development Platanus leaf with 
developed petiole is called petiolated leaf leaf without petiole is 
sessile leaves We can further distinguish the following means of 
attachment to stem sessile clasping connate the bases of two 
leaves are joined sheathing lobes are joined around the stem 
blade is lacking the stalk may expand to phyllodium Acacia 
Stipules often replace sheath on both sides of stalk They 
flat scaly or leafy either attached to the stalk only 
its base or grown up together on both sides Stipules 
scaly protect leaf or flower buds and soon fall off 
change into thorns occasionally see metamorphoses The inner leaf structure 
leaf is covered by the epidermis with cuticle stomata placed 
the bottom of leaf in hypostomatic leaves in majority of 
European deciduous leaves or on both leaf sides amphistomatic leaves 
alba Syringa The leaf surface may be smooth matte shiny 
on the wax cuticle structure wavy concave with frequent trichomes 
epidermis is usually formed by single layer of cells If 
in sunny needles then deeper cells are called the hypodermis 
inner space of leaf is filled with the primary tissue 
There is network of vascular bundles with colenchymatic or sclerenchymatic 
venation conductive and supporting system Sheaths of vascular bundles in 
plants leaves except for hydrangea with isobaric leaves reach both 
lower and upper epidermis They are divided into more or 
independent alveolas spaces known as heterobarical Fig In case of 
injury insect sting or bite the affected group of alveolas 
and the surrounding ones remain functional because the pressure changes 
not reach them Fig Example of heterobarical leaf Upper panel 
damage is visible only in the few alveolas and neighbouring 
are only partly damage Lower panel cross section through middle 
sclerenchyma sheath which connect upper and lower epidermis is visible 
are protected from insulation damage by turning their edges towards 
sunlight Fagus similar reaction is observable with chloroplasts in individual 
cytoskeleton helps them get positioned so that they could take 
as much solar radiation as possible in the weak sunlight 
as little radiation as possible in the direct light According 
the degree of tolerance to density of radiation leaves in 
tops are classified into sun or shade type Fig differing 
the width of cuticle epidermis number of mesophyll layers density 
stomata trichomes sun leaf has thicker skin cuticle thick 
multilayer palisade parenchyma higher density of stomata little volume of 
and higher density of venation generally higher weight of dry 
related to unit of leaf area The position of leaf 
space defines its water saturation if deficient they fade or 
die in green state Fig Example of sun shoot with 
needle organization and thicker needles upper panel and shade shoot 
spare needle oraganization Mesophyll is basic leaf tissue derived from 
stem primary bark It fulfils the assimilation photosynthetic function chlorenchym 
bifacial leaves it is divided into palisade and spongy layers 
parenchyma Fig and On other hand this distinction is less 
in the monofacial leaves similarly as in the case of 
of angiosperms whose mesophyll makes shoulder cells spruce pine In 
and fir needles mesophyll is divided into the palisade and 
parenchyma and darker upper and lighter lower sides are well 
Plants with photosynthesis have parenchyma sheath around vascular bundles coronary 
What is important for the exchange of gases is segmentation 
mesophyll size of intercellulars of the total leaf volume and 
surface area of mesophyll cells inner surface that may exceed 
the outer surface of leaf it serves for speeded gas 
and solution of gases in water film of cell walls 
Inner structure of bifacial leaf consist of palisade and spongy 
cuticle is layer produced by epidermis walls on the outside 
above ground structures leaves and stems It is made of 
These are esters of higher monocarboxyl acids and higher aliphatic 
usually in compound with paraffines alcohols The cuticle prevents 
drying but also from an exchange of oxygen and carbon 
It is typically structured into trichytes lathes grains moulds 
urban atmosphere polluted by exhaust gases aggressive aerosoles and emissions 
to its damage At the end of leaf life it 
discontinuous and crackly which may make cuticle transpiration exceed stomata 
The rate of dying of leaves is enhanced by water 
stoma consists of two guard kidney shaped cells with an 
space in between outer walls of both cells are fixed 
the surrounding epidermis cells The openness of the stoma can 
regulated While surrounding epidermis cells do not contain chloroplasts the 
stoma cells contain them Due to the photosynthesis assimilation of 
and potassium ions stomata can control water accumulation which helps 
change the volume The utilized size of cell wall makes 
long if they are saturated with water which opens the 
On the contrary if there is lack of water cells 
get shorter and the stoma shuts Stomata are typical for 
leaf epidermis but they also exists in the epidermis of 
and young stems Open stomata supply chlorenchym photosynthesis with carbon 
and cool leaves by water vapour transpiration Moves of guard 
are driven by the temperature light water content in leaves 
the soil content in intercellulars of leaf wind
rate of gas diffusion depends on the openness size shape 
and density of stomata generally on stomata resistance high stomata 
can be observed in leaves with submerged tiny densely grouped 
per mm and quickly reacting stomata protected by waxes and 
Hydatods made of two guide cells with are permanently open 
They are located on leaf tips or on the edges 
blade teeth or fringes tissue with numerous intercellular spaces leads 
them epithem They serve for gutation exclusion of excess water 
leaves Salix Ulmus Sambucus There are also wood species that 
gutation and hydatods Tilia Acer pseudoplatanus Trichomes are unicellular 
multicellular simple or branched outgrowths of epidermis cells of leaves 
stems The simplest papillae cause the velvet appearance of petals 
enable easy capturing of pollen on stigmas Unicellular trichomes may 
as water reservoirs plant protection from excessive water vapour radiation 
in temperature Branched or multicellular trichomes make perfect isolation 
Hippophae Viburnum lantana Some types are important for their secretion 
secretion trichomes file of vascular bundles in blade of assimilation 
and other leaf organs petals is generally called venation It 
sometimes more visible from the bottom of leaves and if 
are transparent they can be seen against the light The 
veins in blades with palmate venation direct in rays from 
tip of stalk or blade base such as Acer platanoides 
pinnate side veins first class turn from the main vein 
the long axis of leaf and these branch further on 
veins of higher classes Fagus Carpinus In monocots venation 
parallel rows of veins of similar width direct from the 
to the tip of leaves bamboo it is often also 
banana and palm trees Dichotomous venation of tree ferns or 
leaves divides several times into halves on the way from 
base to the tip of blade it is also an 
venation Gymnosperms have veins connected with fine anastomoses whose venation 
closed The inner needle structure The structure of needles must 
them to live longer life and to overcome relatively long 
of low temperatures or frost in winter and at the 
time to survive heats and droughts and to be functional 
the growing season This is why needles have xerophyll structure 
are grounded in buds of the previous growing season which 
their future number and structure They begin growing in early 
of the next year depending on nutrients and photosynthates from 
years and they attain their permanent structure in two weeks 
As they grow old needles change into shade type structure 
is reflected in the pigment fond Their structure is really 
to the structure of stem On the surface there is 
with extra cuticle made of wax layers or fine trichomes 
which is an inner layer hypodermis Shoulder like cells of 
are often homogenous and correspond to cells of stem primary 
there are frequent resin ducts The boundary between the mesophyll 
the central cylinder is often made of an endodermis Lying 
and protein cells of transfusion tissue are placed below the 
This tissue is in contact with the central part collaterally 
vascular bundles only divided by very thin phloem xylem rays 
xylem part is close to the upper adaxial side of 
the phloem part to the lower part abaxial Procambium in 
separates more sieve cells than tracheids The shape of the 
cross section may be affected by the number of brachyblast 
Pinus rate of radiation during needle growth Picea and the 
of mesophyll Taxus Abies Larix Needles are sensitive to sudden 
such as disposition to light wind temperature fluctuations If trees 
take in enough water for frost proof modifications before winter 
suffer from water stress and photooxidation of chlorophylls Winter and 
are not favourable for them especially for the individuals living 
roads treated with salt Needles and young needles in particular 
get damaged due to frost drying Fig Cross section of 
needle Stomata are nested and arranged in lines Evaluation of 
state The relation between foliage and other woody plant structures 
heterotrophic is widely used diagnosis means of woody plant prosperity 
weight of foliage expresses the relation of the weight of 
leaves mass to the total dry mass In early stages 
tree life the dry matter of leaves makes up to 
the total mass and due to storing organic matter into 
trunks and branches this rate falls down to or even 
in mature and old age The density of foliage utilized 
of leaves in other words expresses the volume of tree 
space per an average leaf which is higher in dense 
of young trees than in less dense crowns The leaf 
index expressed by the rate of the total cumulative area 
foliage related to the area of crown projection on the 
It can successfully express the area of reception of the 
radiation as well as the area of plant surface This 
varies from to in large deciduous trees sq metre of 
surface is shadowed by sq metres of leaves and may 
as much as threefold in case of conifers Leaf metamorphoses 
general in the course of the long evolution of plants 
have been many cases of complete metamorphoses of the primary 
of leaves accompanied with changes in the structure Cotyledons lower 
upper bracts braceae supporting leaves in whose axil flower or 
develop on stalk Other new structures include covering scales of 
or conifer cones supporting scales of catkins that further lignify 
and covers of inflorescence Cornus mas Metamorphoses of woody plant 
also include shoots spines that have originated from the whole 
Berberis or from stipules Robinia And finally flower originates in 
whole complex of leaves metamorphed for the function of sexual 
Propagation and reproduction of woody plants Woody species are perennial 
anchored in the soil by the root system Therefore any 
from one place to another for finding shelter is not 
and an individual has to be able to conform to 
changes on its site by its own biochemical structural and 
activities There are only exceptional cases when plant could move 
another position due to the solifluction landslide mainly on slide 
water flooding or moving of the soil by water or 
erosion moving by snowslip falling of banks by water abrasion 
Nonetheless as these plant movements are driven by exogenous factors 
has not got much space for the acclimatization and it 
rare phenomenon if plant survives Yet there exists movement of 
plants migration Species spread to new sites that are more 
to them immigrate they could even leave their present sites 
are no more suitable emigrate This movement is facilitated due 
regularly produced diasporas Spreading of diasporas from the parent plant 
and propagation into various distances is defined by their shape 
character number and type of activity of the spreading force 
force includes presence and movement of animals direction and speed 
wind water For instance birch Betula anchenes get carried 
metres away ash Fraxinus excelsior about metres spruce Picea abies 
about metres Means of reproduction and types of diasporas diaspora 
have generative origin changes in the genetics by means of 
or fruits acorn Quercus Fagus berries Berberis this way 
spreading is called dissemination group of individuals that originate in 
genetic way is called generation diaspora may even be of 
asexual origin vegetative This direct continuation of plant life via 
body parts via shoots Robinia pseudoacacia Populus tremula Rosa via 
that easily break off and then root Salix Populus or 
or trunk stools of fallen off individuals Quercus Tilia Salix 
via basal branches creeping on the ground that gradually root 
Fagus Pinus mugo and the like Spreading of vegetative diasporas 
generally called propagation It is mainly practicable in species with 
regeneration ability The vegetative propagation of trees is can be 
successful in unfavourable conditions it diminishes the death rate of 
individuals This is thanks to the fact that the little 
remains connected to its mother plant for longer time and 
polycormon may be more successful in the competition with the 
plants Propagation units could even settle sites with dense vegetation 
seeds would have problem germinating and new sprouts would have 
developing The vegetative reproduction is reserve way of keeping species 
site if conditions for the sexual reproduction flowering are not 
low temperatures in the mountainous altitudes New individuals originating 
an asexual way make clone Artificial vegetative reproduction Human spreads 
retains interesting cultivars variants hybrids in both the ways 
an autovegetative way cuttings slips layering offsets meristem cultures
well as in heterovegetative way grafting suitability of graft and 
influencing each other must be taken into consideration These could 
well applied to number of cases but always being aware 
the fact that this is rare phenomenon in the phylogenesis 
term plant evolution on Earth On the other hand vegetative 
is typical for the reproduction of lower organisms bacteria with 
short lives mutation and horizontal transcription of information play vital 
in the survival of species Artificial vegetative reproduction of woody 
is only reasonable in special cases and for special intentions 
instance if we wish to sustain multiple or distant crossbreeds 
or other genotype valuable individuals with weak reproduction activity or 
or senile individuals or if we wish to retain genetic 
and create cultivation populations testing plantations or populations for hybridisation 
and following populations for the mass reproduction Individuals in clone 
have required united appearance and characteristics of the parent organism 
they could also gain undesirable changes direction of growing and 
below the apex control value especially conifers In the adult 
the expected height might not be reached there may be 
in the formation of generative organs most frequently with monoecious 
whose flower sexuality is not controlled by heterochromosomes grafts of 
tend not to reproduce female cones Furthermore they could get 
sooner their stability could be worsened due to lower wood 
and persistence to phytofagous insects and phytopatogenous fungi Another disadvantage 
the changing environment is lowered adaptability due to which cloned 
need to be regularly observed and treated limiting of suckers 
drafts Plant life cycle and the significance of seeds in 
of plants The plant life cycle consists of sexual generative 
and asexual vegetative diploid generations In the phylogenesis there is 
evident shift from completely absent changes of reproductive organs in 
and rare occurrence with fungi to well developed multiple and 
changes with an independent algae green brown red and prevailing 
mainly in bryophytes and pteridophytes Seed plants have asexual diploid 
called zygote seed develops from the zygote and finally an 
plant consisting of root stem leaf sexual haploid gametophyte is 
to dependent part of sporophyte and is created only in 
adult stage after the first flowering male in pollen grain 
in an ovum Plant life cycle enables for regular change 
genetic information when forming new generation by combining and recombining 
and achieving longer life of an individual Seed plants present 
wide taxonomic groups One of the groups angiosperm have taken 
greatest steps in the plant evolution new type of seeds 
after double fertilization of an ovum one pollen grain nucleus 
with the ovum cell nucleus to form zygote an embryo 
new individual develops from the zygote the second nucleus of 
pollen grain merges with the central nucleus of the embryonic 
and becomes ground for the nutrient tissues endosperm whose cells 
triple chromosome code This background which was given to daughter 
by the parent generation resulted in swift entrance of gymnosperms 
of huge number of flora species and quick occupation of 
the continents in late Mesozoic era and in early Tertiary 
The formation of seeds and their number is only possible 
maturity fertility of an individual and is affected by number 
photosynthates rate of these photosynthates transported to the generative organ 
the size of seeds into which energy is transformed The 
energetic demands of flowering development of fruits and seeds do 
allow many tree species regular yearly activity but only in 
years which may be of various period depending on species 
endogenous and exogenous conditions At present when the total year 
sum grows some species flower more frequently which is not 
for them number of individuals mainly in the Picea family 
every two or three years Flowering and mainly formation of 
cones takes place in the top third of tree crowns 
are more exposed to the solar radiation and temperature changes 
transpiration and frequent water stress and higher demands on good 
photosynthesis The combination of stressors may result in the dying 
needles and creation of hole or in the limitation of 
of growth and branching of the first class sudden thinning 
crown It can also be the means of growing plants 
nurseries that cause changes in tree performance very sensitive species 
larch Larix which can flower as early as at the 
of years after having repetitively injured roots Comparisons between species 
that the number of produced seeds is often in negative 
with their size large number of very light single seed 
of birches on the contrary palm tree Lodoicea seychellarum makes 
with the largest seed in the plant realm weighing to 
But in general seeds are very little variable their special 
weigh characteristics vary only slightly Moving of diasporas to new 
also depends on the distance from the source population on 
that may prevent diasporas from spreading mountains waters The 
of life diasporas germinated seeds varies by species and environmental 
The longest lifetime and germinability are observed in seeds of 
and biennials plants goosefoot Chenopodium album spurry Spergula arvensis up 
years while relative short life is seen in large seeds 
walnut Juglans regia haselnut Corylus colurna or oak Quercus petraea 
short lifetime is observed in willow Salix caprea only about 
The plant ability to survive in dormant state in the 
of diasporas is result of long plant evolution and adaptations 
exogenous conditions In immobile plants dormation of diasporas in connection 
their dissemination is analogic to an escape of animals from 
locations The length of dormation and conditions of its interruption 
be genetically defined primary dormation in some species and present 
adaptation to climatic conditions in the centre of their habitat 
period of seeds may be even caused by unfavourable exogenous 
secondary dormation quiescence When conditions improve in species living in 
after coverings of the soil surface seeds soon germinate Not 
seeds and other types of diasporas but also grown seedlings 
remain in some state of quiescence with very limited metabolism 
bad living conditions Under an adult stand of trees and 
or in the shadow of building groups of seedlings of 
plants could persist for number of years Fagus Quercus Acer 
growing due to the weak radiation lack of soil humidity 
as an outcome of adult trees roots suction keeps these 
of seedlings in juvenile stage of the ontogenesis with relatively 
yearly mortality These are candidates for quick launch of growth 
soon as the area gets cleared up Dissemination by diasporas 
generative type During the sexual reproduction creation of diasporas of 
origin seeds fruits genotypes are renewed or completely new 
originate during the formation of zygotes This means that the 
among individuals in population increases hard competitive natural selection comes 
the scene mainly with utilized adaptation characteristics both in parents 
young population The natural selection affected by accidental events isolation 
takes place under the pressure for the initiation and differentiation

inflorescences If the inflorescences comprise of the same type inflorescences 
are known as homoeothetic For instance they could be only 
either of cluster or cyme subunits If the compound subunits 
different these inflorescences are called heterothetic These consist of both 
cluster and cyme units From the perspective of evolution inflorescence 
more advanced that single flowers Male reproductive organs are stamens 
reproductive organs are carpels Flowers with both these sexes are 
bisexual Diclinous unisexual are the ones that only have either 
stamens or female carpels If neither is present these flowers

have two layered walls tough outer wall called the exine 
cutin sporopolenin and thin inner wall called the intine At 
grain sides there are often air sacs Pinus in the 
family grains are grouped in fours mature pollen grain in 
contains vegetative cell tubular that disappears when pollen tubes germinate

There are also the stamens that do not create pollen 
these could be modified into scales plates or honey containers 
female reproductive leaves of gymnosperms are replaced by seed scales 
angiosperms they consits of stigma style and ovary bearing ovules

grains It has various flaps sculpturings and hairs Pollen in 
mucous presence germinates in pollen tubes which penetrate through styles 
an ovule For instance it takes place weeks from the

lower part of carpel From the perspective of the position 
stamens and perianth we distinguish between superior ovary other organs 
ovary half inferior other organs around the upper part of 
ovary and inferior ovary other organs above an ovary An 
is tied to the inner layer of an ovary by 
that passes to the ovule base chalaza where one or 
integuments develop They surround the inner multicellular tissue nucellus with 
opening on the top which is place micropyle for an 
of pollen tube in the process of fertilization During an 
development megaspore differentiates from an inner nucellus under micropyla and 
cell gives rise either by dividing or directly to an 
sac After its reduction dividing three of its daughter cells 
and the fourth megametophyte presents haploid female sporangium embryo sac 
sporangium undergoes multiple division in angiosperms This results in two 
of four cells one group positioned near the micropylar and 
other near the chalaza ends One cell of each of 
groups differentiate diploid nucleus of embryo sac and three cell 
remain in micropyle an ovule set made of oosphere and 
helping cells synergids in chalaza triplet of cells are antipod

is simpler The embryo sac has couple of archegonia at 
micropylar end where egg channel cell develops Nucellus is place 
formation of haploid tissue primary endosperm This is formed by 
high number of cells prior to fertilization Ovules are naked 
accessible to pollen grains The grains captured on pollination drop 
by micropylas are soaked inside as is dries down It

to prevent from autogamy stamens and pistils in flower mature 
different times dichogamy in both sexes of woody plants For 
in apples stigmas mature first and they are fertilized from

al Photosynthesis Photosynthesis from Greek phos phot light is an 
synthetic action occurring in autotrophic photosynthetic organisms photosynthetic bacteria algae 
green plants whose activity is necessary for the existence of 
other processes in life organisms respiration and syntheses of all 
of organic material of the whole biosphere on Earth Photosynthesis 
the reception and binding of electromagnetic energy of solar radiation 
the energy of chemical bonds its utilization for breaking water 
photolysis which enriches the atmosphere with oxygen and which facilitates 
of atoms of carbon oxygen from atmospheric carbon dioxide and 
from water into simple saccharide molecules Every mol of receipted 
dioxide corresponds to kJ of potential energy By subsequent processes 
create small molecules of aminoacids nucleotids and fatty acids incorporated 
various metabolic ways into proteins nucleic acids polysaccharides and lipids 
the foundations of the above molecular functional and structural systems 
these complex synthetic processes come after the respiration process characteristic 
all life organisms their living cells Organic substances primarily originated 
photosynthesis function as nutrition molecules for heterotrophic organisms unable to 
only from inorganic sources herbivores omnivores parasites saprophytes In this 
all photosynthetic organisms are producers of organic matter and all 
life forms consumers reducers living of decomposition mineralization of died 
of any organisms are dependent on them Photosynthesis involves photochemical 
requiring light primary processes enzymatic processes not requiring light dark 
reactions and diffusion processes facilitating the exchange of carbon dioxide 
oxygen Solar radiation is absorbed by photosynthetically active pigments that 
in leaf mesophyll cells in primary bark of petioles and 
branches and other green parts of the above ground system 
higher plants contain chlorophyll and chlorophyll Chlorophylls are porphyrins derivates 
tetrapyrole joined to complexly bound cation Mg These are very 
to human haemoglobin in erythrocytes but containing ferrous atom Their 
and function is defined by the molecular structure including the 
in the protein complex of chloroplast membranes thykaloids The content 
chlorophyll blue green more active is times higher than the 
of yellow green chlorophyll in shaded places twice and more 
in leaves in the sunlight In dry matter of leaves 
make about to depending on species position in the crown 
stage radiation conditions nutrition daily renewal of chlorophylls is 
the total content Porphyrin sections of chlorophyll molecules are bound 
non polar linear chain of phytol settling in chloroplast membrane 
secure them special position carotenoids orange carotens and caroten and 
and brown xantophyls xantophyl zeaxanthin violaxantin Carotenoids are isopren 
however they have linear arrangement The alternation of double and 
bonds with delocalized free electrons is typical for them as 
as in chlorophylls This makes both systems capable of receipting 
part of radiation of certain range of wavelength the remaining 
is reflected and released back This reflected radiation is perceived 
human eyesight as complementary colour to the absorbed colour leaves 
green while they absorb blue and red range of visible 
Carotenoids have light absorbing antioxidation and ecological warning signal for 
and animals that disperse seeds of eaten fruit functions The 
stage of the photosynthesis is the reception of radiant energy 
be more specific this means the entry of radiation influenced 
spatial arrangement of branches and the foliage area in tree 
or above ground system of bush liana and other forms 
of chlorenchyma tissues with cells containing chloroplasts in general arrangement 
chloroplasts within cells and arrangement of pigment antenna systems The 
reaction centre of photosynthesis is chlorophyll Other colours serve as 
colours that with the cooperation of enzymes and proteins form 
light reception antennas these serve for the reception of photons 
control of their flow to chlorophyll In the first stage 
photosynthetic processes the solar energy is captured and stored temporarily 
the energy of chemical bonds of special small molecules of 
adenosintriphosphate in general this molecule serves as storage of quick 
in all life cells even animal cells At the same 
energy is placed into molecule of reduction agent coenzyme nicotinamide 
dinucleotide phosphate Both molecules are primary products of photosynthesis 
serve as energy and reactive chemical groups transmitters The processes 
this stage take place on thykaloid membranes of chloroplasts in 
interconnected steps by means of photosystems complexes of protein molecules 
hundreds of molecules of photosynthetic pigments This is the photosystem 
older existing already in photosynthesising bacteria Then there is the 
evolutionarily younger Photosystem absorbs radiant energy of wavelengths about 
reaction centre receipts hydrogen for the reduction of photosystem 
absorbs radiation of shorter wavelengths reaction centre dissolves water molecules 
into molecular oxygen and hydrogen which is used for 
Oxygen as by product of primary processes is released into 
air and is necessary for breathing of all aerobic organisms 
humans In the second stage secondary photosynthetic processes molecules from 
primary processes are utilized They give energy and reduction potential 
the process of carbon fixation This produces saccharides out of 
atmospheric carbon dioxide entering plants through stomata or lenticels 
water taken in by plant roots from the soil This 
is located in chloroplast stroma It does not require light 
depends on the primary stage anyway it finishes soon after 
dark as well The process of incorporation of carbon from 
into organic bonds is defined by plant species In case 
woody plants there are two types In the Calvin cycle 
acceptor of is carbon saccharide ribulose biphosphate RuBP enzym 
which reduces after the reception of carbon atom into two 
carbon molecules This way is used by plant species and 
is catalysed by specific enzyme Rubisco In the other cycle 
Hatch Slack pathway acceptor is tree carbon phosphoenolpyruvate PEP 
carbon product after the fixation of carbon atom This is 
of photosynthesis in plants where both Rubisco enzyme and PEP 
enzyme participate The final products of both synthetic ways are 
photosynthates outcome compounds of all other substances in body and 
receptor or carbon acceptor Acc In central European conditions 
with photosynthesis prevail They are more sensitive to high temperatures 
and lack of nitrogen Hatch Slack process is present in 
of thermophyll tropical species Casings around vascular bundles with cells 
chloroplasts are typical for plants with the Hatch Slack process 
there are even such cases of plants with both types 
photosynthesis such as corn in our climate Primary photosynthetic processes 
be expressed by these entry factors and outcome products radiant 
photons chlorophylls phosphate Secondary processes utilize 
of the primary photosynthetic process and renew the entry factors 
glucose phosphate thermal energy 
saccharide and molecules with rich energy phosphate bond generated 
photophosphorisation are only utilized as source of energy for chemical 
and source of material for the preparation of range of 
small organic molecules necessary for plant cell The impact photosynthesis 
exogenous and endogenous factors on The photosynthesis outcomes are saccharides 
basic compounds of all other material in body and renewed 
of The quality of photosynthesis in view to other 
processes respiration is manifested by consumption or release of 
photosynthesis The photosynthesis capacity of species in given stage of 
and activity means the highest speed of reception of
typical content of in the atmosphere and optimal conditions 
other factors light water temperature nutrients The potential photosynthesis 
defined in the conditions of optimal pressure The compensation 
expressed by radiation availability temperature is state of woody 
or its part branch leaves with zero exchange of
rate of photosynthesis consumption of and respiration release of 
If the conditions of the compensation point are long term 
or its part weakens and dies prematurely In shaded woody 
this often results in limited growth limited immunity from pathogens 
loss of basal part of crown self cleaning of crown 
of basal extremely shaded branches Temperature demands for the photosynthesis 
rather lower than for respiration The optimal temperature of central 
tree species is about Conifer needles may have active primary 
processes even in temperatures as low as In temperatures below 
the photosystem finishes High portions of solar radiation long 
days around the noon may lead to the fusion of 
from phytol dephytolation of chlorophyll which makes chlorophyll inactive the 
part of leaf is bleached The acid environment causes replacement 
magnesium atom in chlorophyll molecule by hydrogen atom Moreover this 
the chlorophyll inactive in photosynthesis its green colour changes into 
brown or brown the affect of acid rains browning of 
leaves during the decomposition The most common reason for limitation 
photosynthesis is lack of water reduced transpiration resulting in increased 
heating Besides inadequate transpiration flow photosynthesis could be limited by 
mineral nutrition namely the nutrients necessary for this process
Moreover lack of water in leaves brings 
closing of stomata and an increased resistance of leaf epidermis 
entry into leaf If water stress lasts longer photosynthates 
not taken away from leaves but remain there and accumulate 
substantially limits photosynthesis The speed of photosynthesis is given by 
speed of gas diffusion water gases which is driven 
only by external factors but mainly by factors such as 
position of plant as part of stand or as solitary 
the shape and arrangement of crown and leaves the surface 
leaves the functions of stomata the arrangement of mesophyll the 
of conductive tissues Cells in green plants also contain 
systems of molecules capable of utilization of solar energy However 
activity is more complex than in chlorophylls Such is phytochrome 
of two forms of one molecule type made of chromophore 
protein parts and forms blend into each other after the 
of photon of corresponding wavelength and they make photoreceiptor of 
cells in the red light spectrum Through phytochrome light controls 
of range of enzymes synthesis of nucleic acids proteins chlorophylls 
other elements but also seed germination flowering leaf development and 
off formation of buds exchange in plants The 
metabolism of carbon is connected with the outer environment via 
exchange of gases Chloroplasts consume needed in photosynthesis and 
oxygen At the same time cells constantly absorb oxygen necessary 
respiration and release In given time any of the 
contrary processes may dominate in photosynthesising leaves Respiration active in 
light consists of photorespiration and mitochondrial respiration During the day 
speed of reception needed for photosynthesis related to unit 
biomass usually exceeds the speed of release by respiration 
the light The result is net receipt of by 
If the rate of photosynthesis falls down it may happen 
respiration is high enough to balance it it reaches the 
point see above If the rate of the photosynthetic activity 
to slow down respiration prevails and in the dark there 
only respiration release of For instance metabolism in shaded 
in the crown base or inner periphery or crown core 
the compensation point It is leafless space with inadequate conditions 
long term positive balance of carbon The compensation point may 
even reached due to an increased temperature of leaves above 
speeds up foliage respiration and slows down photosynthesis range of 
stressing factors including protective reactions after injuries may have 
effect Photosynthesis and respiration Photosynthesis and respiration are complementary processes 
plant cells leaf mesophyll cells where both processes happen simultaneously 
separated compartments of chloroplasts and mitochondria On another level these 
processes within one individual plant take place in green parts 
petioles young stems while respiration only takes place in 
cells with lack of light cells inside branches stems trunks 
This means that respiration of cells in the cambial zone 
gives carbon dioxide for the photosynthesis of cells in the 
bark At larger scale we may consider the relation between 
and respiration as similar to relations between producers green plants 
and consumers heterotrophic organisms at first sight completely distinct from 
This means that not all exchanges between plants and animals 
one way Plants animals and bacteria on Earth have coexisted 
so long that some of these organisms have become natural 
of the environment or even body of other organisms Some 
molecules now fixed by the photosynthesis into organic molecules of 
leaf could be released into the atmosphere by breathing of 
animal or by bacteria decomposing dead organic matter day before 
it is clear that the utilization of carbon makes cycle 
involves the biosphere all living organisms on Earth as whole 
extends boundaries among individual organisms It is similar with atoms 
nitrogen phosphor and sulphur moving between organic and inorganic realm 
animals fungi and bacteria Respiration Cells gain energy via the 
of organic molecules Earth atmosphere contains large percentage of oxygen 
bond with oxygen makes the most stable form of carbon 
and the most stable form of hydrogen in This 
that cell is able to gain energy from saccharides or 
organic molecules by allowing their carbon and hydrogen atoms to 
with oxygen and the formation of and Then cell 
this energy into macroergic bonds of This process is 
respiration and gaining energetic reserve of oxidative phosphorylation All organisms 
be specific all their living cells respirate Another mechanism of 
matter decomposition is quick oxidation in burning wood petrol natural 
The summary chemical equation of respiration is sometimes simplified and 
as the opposite to photosynthesis as glucose oxidation and release 
energy carbon dioxide and water Yet respiration is much 
complex it processes in many controlled gradual steps and its 
is wide range of synthetic pathways and coordinations That is 
we recommend that respiration is studied as metabolic centre Plant 
disintegrates complex substances with high potential energy saccharides fats proteins 
simple substances and release of energy This energy serves for 
cell functions intracellular movement maintaining and renewal of structures syntheses 
of heat in spring in opening buds and flowers The 
of respired substrate glucose is several step process glycolysis pyruvate 
acid citric cycle oxidation of final acceptor of electrons
is localized in cytoplasm while acid citric cycle and oxidative 
in mitochondria The yield of the whole disintegration is mols 
adenosintriphosphate mols of GTP glyceraldehyde phosphate and free enthalpy 
per mol of glucoses Besides the release of energy disintegrative 
form high number of useful products that become preconditions for 
lignin Respiration is more effective in presence of oxygen aerobic 
but it may even occur without molecular by means of 
of reduction oxidation reactions forming simpler molecules but still rich 
energy This is anaerobic respiration further classified into fermentation disintegration 
saccharides and lipids and decomposition disintegration of nitrogen organic substances 
is classified by the final accumulated and unprocessed product ethanol 
milk fermentation butter fermentation These processes predominantly give energy 
microorganisms bacteria yeast It may happen even to woody 
that conditions for aerobic respiration of roots are not favourable 
to flooding compaction of soil What is more in decreased 
aeration anaerobic soil bacteria produce potentially toxic compounds such as 
organic compounds alcohols carbonyl group volatile fatty acids non volatile 
phenolic acids and volatile compounds of sulphur In such situation 
the development of tree shoots is affected due to elongation 
their internodes and limitation of formation and spatial growth of 
induction of leaf aging damage and fall off In long 
affecting diameter growth of adult trees slows down and the 
of phloem and xylem is modified Moreover the formation and 
of roots is severely impacted and the root diminishment is 
by acting of Phytophtora mildews The lowered respiration of roots 
in limited photosynthesis rate since it induces the closing of 
and modifies carboxyl enzymes and decreases the content of chlorophyll 
of mineral nutrients falls with lowered area of the root 
and with lack of energy energy release in anaerobic respiration 
weaker and does not meet the needs of root functions 
from roots could be released into soil Modification and reduction 
root growth make trees prone to windthrow The levels or 
ethylen and abscis acid in stem rise while levels of 
and cytokinins fall Globally weakened woody plants incline to attack 
biotic factors Plants or their living cells particularly meristems respire 
during the day and night photosynthesize only in daytime light 
prevails respiration in leaves several fold approx fold Respiration utilizes 
most efficiently from simple saccharides that cannot be accumulated in 
in higher concentration since they are osmotically active They typically 
into other forms or reserve substances polysaccharides most frequently starch 
mainly as reserve in seeds Juglans Fagus Corylus and sometimes 
proteins Structure elements of cell walls in woody plants cannot 
taken back as source of energy even though they are 
type such as cellulose hemicelluloses pectates Finally proteins too 
the aerobic substrate in which aminoacids as foundation stones could 
reused for new or different better functioning structures in reconstruction 
cell walls The process of respiration oxidation of glucose Respiration 
two step process it begins by anaerobic glycolysis and continues 
aerobic disintegration of pyruvic acid or fermentation Anaerobic glycolysis It 
place in cytoplasm along with catalytic activity of enzymes dissolved 
It is only active without the presence of oxygen even 
cells located in aerobic surroundings These two facts prove the 
origin of this metabolic pathway The final product is two 
of pyruvic acid and Aerobic disintegration of pyruvic acid 
mitochondria This process happens into these three stages decarboxylation of 
acid citric acid cycle and respiratory chain Fig decarboxylation of 
acid One atom of carbon in the form splits 
from pyruvic acid which means the acid is 
and in co working with acetyl coenzyme activated acetic acid 
formed citric acid cycle Krebs cycle It progresses in matrix 
activated acetic acid reacts with oxaloacetate which results in the 
of citric acid molecule of and hydrogen are released 
molecules of coenzyme and one molecule of coenzyme
amide dinucleotide reduce by accepting hydrogen and take it in 
respiration cycle respiratory chain This is sequence of oxidation reduction 
Protons as well as electrons bring reduced coenzymes and 
At the beginning protons get released into the neighbourhood Electrons 
transmitted by range of transmitters into the inner membrane of 
in the gradient of electric potential and is synthesised 
the same time synthesis in the respiratory chain is 
oxidative phosphorylation It is very similar to phosphorylation taking place 
thykaloids in photosynthesis Transmission of electrons generates energy which allows 
the transmission of protons via the membrane from matrix to 
space to get accumulated This is process of foundation of 
membrane proton gradient gradient pH induced by different concentration of 
in the matrix and intermembrane space Protons get back into 
matrix through an enzyme that puts energy released during 
into Transmission of two protons into matrix is necessary 
the synthesis of one molecule More is generated 
phosphorylation than in photosynthesis At the end of the chain 
are transmitted to the molecular oxygen This forms oxygen anions 
later join with protons to make water In oxidation processes 
mitochondria molecules of per one molecule of glucose are 
Enzymes catalysing reactions of Krebs cycle and respiration chain are 
and originate in the inner membrane of mitochondria Fig Schema 
main metabolic processes in plant Products of photosynthesis are directly 
to storage reserve starch cell wall cellulose or they entry 
five carbon sugar cycle to nucleotides structure Saccharides fats and 
can entry to process of respiration Not only energy is 
during respiration but also other substance are formed which are 
basis for the secondary plant metabolisms polosaccharides lipids proteins phenols 
hormonones and many others Thus respiration has the key position 
the plant metabolisms Fermentation Pyruvic acid is degraded without the 
of oxygen and reactions stop when semi product is generated 
This is case of ethanol fermentation occurring even in plants 
anaerobic conditions see above Ethanol is toxic particularly to the 
of mitochondria longer anaerobic conditions mainly in summer may lead 
dying of plants More resistant woody species include the ones 
occupy meadows with regular spring flooding or the trees living 
higher altitudes near mountain streams quick and cold water is 
in oxygen Less energy is generated through fermentation than through 
respiration as most energy is bound to final outcomes Factors 
respiration In individual plants flowers and unripe fruits respirate faster 
leaves roots respire faster that stems of shoots The main 
of respiration in branches and trunks are in bark mainly 
living part of phloem cambial zone and outer functional layers 
xylem sapwood containing living cells Growth respiration breathing in growing 
during growth and synthetic processes in cells in seedlings root 
stem apices in opening of leaves and development of fruits 
from to times more intensive that the maintenance respiration winter 
of needles The rate of respiration is directly proportional to 
rate of growing As differentiation and maturation of tissues proceed 
activity weakens temporary sharp rise in respiration occurs during fruit 
and leaf maturation climacteric respiration This is breakdown of substances 
in energy withdrawal of mobile mineral nutrients potassium nitrogen together 
an assimilation of toxins from metabolism into structure that is 
be separated from plant and for preparation of the separation 
layer These enzymatic processes of natural maturation are under strict 
control and depend on favourable conditions of the environment They 
reflected in gradual change of leaf colour in autumn cells 
venation live longest It is not the same as sudden 
due to drought in green state and postponed fall off 
of plant cells is often accompanied with release of gaseous 
products ethylene In winter cells in ash branches work only 
survive and respiration is limited to approx per 
per of fresh biomass As soon as the growth finishes 
September respiration weakens In woody plants respiration increases during the 
diameter growth and remains very active till late August in 
species even longer oak and beech till late October lime 
late as December Respiration in winter is balanced It is 
third to one fourth lower than in high summer So 
rate of respiration does not only alternate during the day 
also during the year Different plant species demonstrate different rate 
respiration in the same conditions For example the average speed 
breathing in leaves of deciduous trees is five times higher 
breathing in assimilation organs of evergreens The rate of released 
and accepted oxygen respiratory quotient is typically one This happens 
if starch is burnt in respiration but if fat is 
fatty seeds Fagus Juglans the respiratory quotient falls bellow one 
from the perspective of plant sustainability the total yearly balance 
photosynthesis and respiration is required to be positive photosynthesis needs 
dominate over respiration Otherwise growth could be endangered The rate 
respiration is affected by number of endogenous and exogenous factors 
endogenous factors include excluding species and individual exceptions growth available 
concentration of organic compounds in cells the higher the concentration 
higher the rate of respiration amount of water in tissues 
begin breathing more intensely as soon as they soak with 
The exogenous factors mainly include temperature respiration intensifies in higher 
to and weakens in lower temperatures Pine needles respire times 
at that at In the temperature range the speed of 
grows twice to three times every plus but between and 
and functionally significant membrane structures are damaged by heat and 
dies down light does not affect respiration air humidity is 
factor higher concentration in the atmosphere slows down respiration 
is harmful injuries enhance respiration intensity related to an active 
and cell division As little as concentration of oxygen will 
sufficient to normal progress of mitochondrial respiration If concentration falls 
this limit at first respiration slows down and then the 
of water ions and root growth decrease Abscisic acid production 
especially in ethylene so the above ground growth is interrupted 
leaves fall off prematurely Inadequate conditions may launch respiration in 
plants without oxygen anaerobic respiration see above This may happen 
roots are flooded or when seed germinates in the muddy 
However this is only an extemporary solution If plants lack 
for longer they die Plants on extremely heavy soils with 
movement of oxygen develop an extensive root system and adventitious 
Pneumatophores aerating roots may be developed as an extreme specialisation 
usually use saccharides for respiration If they happen to require 
other substances such as lipids they modify them into saccharides 
themselves It is only an exception that plant uses proteins 
respiration Photorespiration metabolic process similar to respiration is active in 
part which contain chlorophyll This process co works with photosynthesis 
which is used up and is released in the 
but in contrast to respiration this is not active in 
dark This exchange of for is called photorespiration It 
in chloroplasts moves to peroxisomes and finishes in mitochondria The 
of photorespiratory metabolism is enzyme RuBP Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase 
the intake of oxygen this enzyme splits ribulose bisphosphate which 
having been taken in before The rate between photorespiration 
photosynthesis is controlled by the input of and radiation 
temperature high partial pressure of stimulates photorespiration while photosynthesis 
stimulated by high input of In average conditions and 
in the atmosphere intensive radiation temperatures between plants lose about 
up to of gained through photosynthesis in the form 
photorespiration On the other hand this process uses energy 
from leaf overheating and provides precursors for the renewal of 
Water regime of woody plants Functions of all living organisms 
Earth directly depend on characteristics of water and substances that 
either dissolvent in water ions of inorganic salts monosaccharides proteins 
acids or wettable hydrophilic hygroscopic and soaking cellulose wood 
or on the other hand are water repellent hydrophobic fatty 
lipids The most significant physical characteristics of water include specific 
of ice melting amount of energy needed for the transition 
unit of mass from solid state to liquid state is 
kg specific thermal capacity amount of energy needed for heating 
of mass of of water in liquid state is kJ 
specific boiling heat amount of energy needed for the transition 
unit of mass from liquid state to gaseous state is 
kg which are extremely high values in comparison to other 
In transition from the liquid to solid state there is 
increase in volume meaning reduction in density ice floats on 
Water density is almost exactly kg one litre of water 
one kg Volume heat expansion is negligible in both the 
liquid and solid compared to volume changes during melting or 
We could say that water rarely changes its volume with 
temperatures which is true for both the stages liquid or 
Nonetheless there exists little relation to temperatures as it is 
that the highest density of water is at the temperature 
Like all liquids water has measurable surface tension This is 
needed to extend liquid surface area of This value equals 
in weightless state has spherical shape with the smallest area 
to volume Viscosity tells us how easily liquid can flow 
lower the viscosity surface tension the weaker the resistance of 
flowing through pipe through vessels in case of woods The 
conductivity of pure water in normal conditions is so low 
it could be considered great non conductor negligible electrical conductivity 
caused by little amount of dissociated molecules present in the 
or hydronium ions and hydroxide ions Nonetheless dissolvation of 
other elements that tend to dissociate may increase the conductivity 
water solution to several fold molecule of water contains two 
atoms and central oxygen atom that form an angle of 
solid state ice this angle slightly oscillates in liquid state 
though the water molecule behaves neutrally protons positioned in this 
from the oxygen atom surface cause certain polarity weak positive 
on one side of the molecule It results in an 
of the positive charge side of water molecule by negative 
of neighbouring water or other molecule These weak interactions appearing 
range of organic molecules energy from to kJ mol are 
hydrogen bonds In case of water these are the factors 
for its abnormal performance being liquid in range from to 
polar dissolvent forming true and colloid solutions The cohesiveness of 
molecules among each other is called cohesion the cohesiveness of 
molecules with other molecules is called adhesion Cohesion and adhesion 
water together with hydrogen bonds with range of other structures 
compactness of plant bodies constant volume and non compresiveness of 
water is responsible for the diameter growth of cells and 
self supporting capacity of unlignified parts of plants leaves young 
Water inside cell vacuoles develops an internal pressure on 
cell wall turgor In balanced pressure of vacuole and resistance 
the cell wall there is state of fulfilled cell turgor 
cells are turgescent they develop mutual pressure and tissues remain 
In loss of water they wither There are numerous cases 
cell walls in tissues are arranged in such way that 
attract molecules of water in various ways and various directions 
in water content leads to movements of the whole organs 
their parts change in leaf position in space and tilting 
movements of leaves after being touched Mimosa opening and closing 
pores movements of flower sections opening and closing of cones 
changes in position of the whole branches as result of 
of reaction wood Values of specific heat of ice melting 
boiling and specific heat capacity of water tell us lot 
the exceptional performance of water in plant tissue thermoregulation Parts 
woody plants with high content of water apices fleshy fruits 
woody species cambial zone have high thermal stability The 
of heat in water vapour from leaves transpiration is very 
for cooling of these On the contrary in the process 
water freezing cooling of tissues slows down The described water 
changes during melting and freezing are primary factor of damage 
plant tissues particularly in repetitive or quick fluctuations of temperatures 
Other water capabilities such as performing as reagent donor and 
of electrons and as mobile dissolvent point out to its 
significance that cannot be substituted Gradients in rainfall contrast expositions 
differences in texture and depth of soil that play vital 
in water balance of plants have an impact on vegetation 
types and functional state Water also plays an important role 
decomposition erosion and control over nutrients in the soil Water 
is closely tied to mineral nutrition photosynthesis respiration growth and 
of plant organs Water content and its thermodynamic state From 
perspective of phylogenetics life originated in water and water remains 
primary medium of biochemical processes in plants Cytoplasma contains almost 
water on average of fresh mass weight organelles rich in 
as well as chloroplasts and mitochondria contain around of water 
regarding the whole organs or tissues leaves and fine roots 
about conductive parts of xylem sapwood about Above ground parts 
terrestrial plants permanently lose water by evapotranspiration By the ability 
plants to compensate short time oscillation of water content and 
sustain loss of water these types of plants are distinguished 
and homoiohydric Poikilohydric plants fungi some algae and lichens adjust 
water content to the humidity of the neighbourhood they contain 
cells without central vacuoles If dry their volume diminishes and 
vital functions are suppressed without any damage to protoplast Cells 
homoiohydric plants contain set of vacuoles that can balance the 
of extragenous humidity conditions to certain extent The development of 
trichomes control of transpiration through pores suberinized surfaces and ventilation 
the development of long distance conductive systems and complex root 
securing water uptake all of these have made terrestrial plants 
of retaining their inner balance even in sudden changes in 
in their neighbourhood and this capability has allowed for the 
spread of plants Even homoiohydric plants have stages when they 
as poikilohydric and can sustain significant losses of water This 
ripe seeds that retain the germination capacity for long time 
to hundreds of years by minimisation of vital processes along 
radical limitation of hydratation water content may fall below Most 
hydratation water is bound in cytoplasm and cell wall in 
power of or more MPa depending on the density of 
fibres Forces that bond water to structural elements of matrix 
wall colloids are defined as matrix potential In the qualitative 
of view the significance of water contained in cell grows 
the rate of its availability The most accessible water is 
in all vacuoles cell compartments specialized as water reservoirs or 
dead cells serving as hydrocytes Over half of water content 
leaves is accumulated like this Though neither this water is 
mobile as it is osmotically bound to dissolved substances such 
saccharides organic acids secondary metabolites of plants and ions Forces 
bind water in dilutions are altogether called an osmotic potential 
purified water has the highest specific free energy potential to 
activities dissolve ions cover coloid particles and to move freely 
potential of chemically pure water is foundation for expressing relative 
potential of water which is tied by various forces in 
place in the system of soil plant atmosphere The chemically 
water potential is the highest meaning zero and the potential 
water bound in systems lowers is negative It depends on 
above mentioned osmotic potential concentration of osmotically active substances oligosaccharides 
plant salts in soil pressure potential turgor stress on cell 
from the inside of cells and hydrostatic pressure and matrix 
adhesion to cell walls water cohesion of colloids Water 
may be understood as an activity needed to develop to 
the potential of bound water up to the grade of 
water It is usually expressed as an amount of energy 
volume unit per as unit of energy per amount of 
mol or as pressure MPa The osmotic potential of solution 
down not only with the growing number of diluted substances 
also with the rising temperatures Macromolecular substances may be present 
high weight amounts without any significant decrease in osmotic potential 
polymeration of small molecules to macromolecules change of saccharide into 
and this process reversion hydrolysis may highly affect osmotic potential 
solution which means that the net flow of water may 
controlled by plant In protoplasts with central vacuole there is 
relation between osmotically bound water in cell and its availability 
cytoplasm Water availability is expressed as total water potential of 
water system cells cell compartment or outer solution usually symbolized 
which means that the more negative the water potential of 
system the lower the water availability from the system to 
neighbourhood An osmotic component of water potential depends on the 
and concentration of dilution and is expressed by Van Hoff 
Ns universal gas invariable mol absolute temperature water density Ns 
sum of moles in dilution per unit of water weight 
symplast or water volume in cell osmotic coefficient that includes 
ideal characteristics of given dilution in the thermodynamic perspective Besides 
osmotic constituent of water potential the total water potential of 
system contains matrix and pressure potential constituents difference in potentials 
places with different values of water potential is situation analogical 
electrical circuit with points of different voltages measured in Volts 
current tends to flow from place of higher voltage into 
of lower voltage in the circuit It is similar in 
plant the current of water flows from places of higher 
potential positive less negative into the places of lower water 
more negative The movement of water in cell There are 
mutually interconnected water circulation systems in woody plants Water circulation 
cell small circulation and circulation in the whole plant large 
The small circulation secures continual exchange of substances in cell 
the large circulation secures transpiration and assimilation flow All the 
in plant may only be realized in the state of 
hydratation Water moves from places of higher water potential average 
in soil to MPa into places with lower water potential 
roots with values to as far as leaves with lowered 
potential to MPa and then into the atmosphere with values 
dozens or hundreds of MPa Another way of balancing different 
of water potential is direct movement of diluted substances diffusion 
only in the apoplast in intercellular spaces Though this is 
by semipermeability of vacuole membranes tonoplasts and cytoplasm plasmalema that 
free water molecules The output process is osmosis Water flows 
cell situated in the environment of higher osmotic potential hypotonic 
another place if cell wall resists the pressure from the 
If cell wall solidity is lower cell bursts plasmoptysis On 
other hand in conditions of lower osmotic potential water flows 
of the cell and protoplast limits its volume plasmolysis If 
cell is transported into hypotonic environment it may be returned 
its former state by means of deplasmolysis Otherwise it dies 
processes are important for the diagnosis of health state of 
and cell membranes If they are damaged or injured substances 
its neighbourhood are free to enter the cell and material 
the inside of cell can move out Protoplast loses its 
of selecting passing substances If cells are only partially saturated 
water there is state of hydratation deficit This is cause 
water flow in cell or in plant If water deficit 
certain limit life sustaining processes in cell weaken plant needs 
amounts of water in different life stages and water potential 
cells changes by this Water saturation deficit Water saturation deficit 
is an amount of water that plant lacks to its 
saturation It is expressed in percentage and related to the 
content of water in plant Variables of the original weight 
after saturation and weight of dry mass are studied in 
to calculate the deficit After little loss of water and 
regaining plants renew their natural colour and turgor of cells 
water deficit that will suffice for re saturation of cells 
any damage is called critical water deficit sublethal deficit is 
state that projects in plant the first damage and lethal 
is state of serious damage to plant disabling full saturation 
the future Water deficit has grave impact on metabolism and 
of cells it slows down primary life functions of plant 
its growth Water potential of plants Water potential of plant 
related with other physiological processes and its annual growth An 
constituent of water potential is cellular water potential exogenous factors 
availability of physiologically present water solar radiation temperature and variations 
temperature and other factors Values of water potential of plants 
during the day Minimal values occur in the midday or 
the early afternoon Due to irrigation the value of water 
of root tissues quickly rises Water potential of soil Soil 
is the total content of water in the soil at 
moment and in given conditions The mobility of soil water 
forces that tie water in the soil are factors that 
usability of soil water by plants The total amount of 
in soil is called the water capacity of soil It 
depends on the size of soil elements The smaller the 
size of soil elements the larger the water capacity of 
plant cannot utilize all water contained in the soil Water 
of soil is the decisive factor of its usability by 
It is vector sum of forces that bind water in 
soil It comprises of the total water content in soil 
osmotic value of soil solution If we take into consideration 
forms of water in the soil hygroscopic adhesive capillary and 
water only capillary water is physiologically utilizable to plants Differences 
the absolute and biologically utilizable water content in different soils 
substrates are significant for the determination of wilting point This 
is critical content of water in the soil below which 
starts withering The uptake and conduct of water Transport of 
from soil to roots Water passes into root through rhisodermis 
it migrates through cell walls of the primary cork to 
of xylem parenchyma The movement of water from soil to 
is realized by forces of apoplastic movement allowed by cell 
micellae and colloid state of cell content The following movement 
water in root is realized in symplastic way through cytoplasm 
from vacuoles and through plasmodems The last water movement is 
by osmotic potential among vacuoles Water potential falls from the 
towards the central cylinder sharp fall in water potential occurs 
the transition of cells of storage parenchyma through endodermis into 
conductive part On one hand cells soak water in and 
the other they push it out actively Differences in the 
of water potential in individual parts of cell water potential 
the outer side of cell is higher than in the 
nearer the root centre are conditioned by the activities of 
protoplast Water transport is not realized only in one way 
it complex process Water conduction in root There are two 
of water uptake by the root system active and passive 
active uptake is characteristic for low release of water by 
the passive intake occurs in an intensive release of water 
active uptake biological of water by the root utilizes energy 
material metabolism The loss of water in transpiration brings about 
under pressure which leads to soaking of water in the 
uptake The uptake and movement of water in plant is 
described by the process of electroosmosis meaning the movement of 
phase water in an electric field towards an electrode with 
opposite charge The electroosmosis is only active if disperged phase 
immobile and if only the disperging environment is mobile In 
cells elements of the surface layer of immobile protoplast are 
positively or negatively charged which means that water solution moves 
the negatively charged inner surface of protoplast The outer and 
layers of protoplast form boundary between the water solution as 
outer environment vacuole and cell flesh as the inner environment 
these are media of electric charges There is potential difference 
these two bordering surfaces Water solution contains ions of opposite 
and hydratation coat which carry water adhering to them the 
the solution concentration the more water passes into cells Yet 
passing of water into cells greatly depends on the intensity 
life processes respiration and on conditions of the exogenous environment 
to the described processes there are changes to the electric 
on the surface of protoplast Root pressure Movement of water 
root develops pressure that pushes water upwards into higher tissues 
plant It is caused by forces of colloid systems and 
forces of protoplast or root cells Root pressure is physiological 
requiring high amount of energy It is active in spring 
means of an intense hydrolysis of starch into dissolvent saccharides 
tree roots This process limits osmotic constituent of water potential 
root structure When the soil has suitable humidity soil water 
into roots due to electric gradient and is further pushed 
into the above ground system After watering budding and development 
leaves the root pressure falls down Root pressure may be 
during plant injuries in spring prior to budding of leaves 
flows off scar after trauma Betula Vitis vinifera Besides 
this liquid contains organic substances such as saccharides amino acids 
acids enzymes phytohormones mineral salts This bleeding is economically 
for gaining organic material in many industrial branches sugar from 
saccharum Root pressure is highest in the morning and in 
evening which corresponds to the values of water saturation deficit 
pressure potential Root pressure only develops slow movement of water 
is not able to transport large amounts of water quickly 
the higher locations The impact of various factors on root 
of water Environmental factors or water uptake by plants are 
or indirect Direct forces on water uptake by roots are 
ones that control transpiration of plants release of water Other 
include factors that control root growth since water is only 
in by young growing roots Soil conditions belong to indirect 
for example the content of water in soil temperature and 
of soil water potential of soil water values The 
temperature considerably affects water absorption by roots If lowered to 
above ground parts of plant wither even if they give 
only little water On the other hand as soon as 
temperature rises to plants return to their normal state Thermophilic 
limit water uptake at temperatures as high as and they 
stop this activity at On the contrary plants adapted to 
temperatures ash birch take in water even at lower temperatures 
The optimal temperature for intake of water is about for 
majority of woody plants The best conditions for fluent intake 
water are when soil temperature is lower than air temperature 
corresponds to the temperature gradient of different species Though cold 
is physiologically dry no matter how much water it may 
higher altitudes Low temperatures affect protoplast viscosity which results in 
changing in passing of water through the membrane system of 
cells Temperatures too have an impact on diffusion and other 
and chemical processes in root cells Soil aeration mainly the 
of carbon dioxide and oxygen controls water uptake by the 
system Woody plants need oxygen for respiration growth metabolism and 
normal activity of the whole root system lack of oxygen 
respiration which further affects an active uptake of water and 
The optimal content of oxygen in soil is about Too 
or high content of carbon dioxide limits sometimes even stops 
uptake of water as well rate between oxygen and carbon 
that does not comply with optimal plant activities occurs on 
or flooded soils The water uptake can only be satisfactory 
sufficient amount of physiologically available water is present in the 
The optimal water uptake by plants occurs at of maximal 
water capacity of soil The most important is the soil 
with roots making physiologically active profile vegetation layer This depends 
species and age of an individual and on characteristics of 
layers Soil solutions need to have really low concentration to 
order to sustain fluent water uptake Electrolytes enhance water permeability 
cell while non electrolytes limit it An experiment comparing solution 
demonstrated that solution of the MPa osmotic potential enabled plants 
take in more water up to times more than solution 
MPa osmotic potential in case they could not quickly adapt 
the environment In changing concentrations of soil solution the water 
more or less slows down in relation with mineral nutrition 
It is mainly the nitrate nitrogen that can boost the 
of water by roots Transpiration flow Water taken up by 
root system in exceptional cases little percentage also by the 
ground structures is conducted in various directions and to different 
into all body parts At first water trespasses root radially 
rhisodermis to xylem conductive pathways this is short or medium 
transport The second stage includes long distance transport of water 
xylem elements In the third stage water is transported from 
pathways xylem through leaf mesophyll to epidermis cells in leaves 
it evaporates out into the atmosphere Water taken up by 
sets out on way that could be very long often 
in trees Water can successfully overcome long distances only via 
bundles The driving force of the flow is gradient in 
potentials between two opposite apices The flow could be broken 
lot of resistance factors such as frictional force gravitation potential 
Plants especially woody species have developed perfect systems of tracheids 
or both for the conduct of water on long distances 
moving upwards via tracheids is filtered through pit pairs of 
tilting closings end walls Tracheids are narrow their conductiveness is 
than in the case of vessels Vessels consist of individual 
elements standing one on top of another their cross compartments 
performed to different measure The weakest resistance of water conduct 
developed by liana vessels Movement of water in deciduous woody 
is easiest in the vertical direction It is slowest in 
since the pathways are not vertical but they are often 
Neither is it easy for water to move in the 
direction into phloem xylem rays that distribute water in the 
direction with slight gradient of osmotic potential The highest stage 
evolution is demonstrated by the conductive tissues in trees The 
annual rings and young wood conduct water best while the 
wood does not conduct water at all The movement of 
in vessels is completely different from the movement in parenchyma 
The current of water in vessels is directed by the 
of hydrodynamics while in living cells water moves by the 
of osmosis and overcomes the resistance of cell walls The 
important factor in water upward movement from roots into leaves 
water cohesion and adhesion to cell walls Cohesion forces can 
water above barometric pressure level and reach to MPa Water 
from root to transpiring parenchyma parenchyma consists of cells with 
water potential several MPa in woody plants to MPa These 
attract water from vessels This generates voltage in vessels between 
film molecules that move along the walls so it appears 
if all water was hanging on leaf cells If there 
sufficient amount of water in soil and if vapour is 
root cells support the water continuum in vessels thus decreasing 
voltage and enhancing its upward flow Besides water potential differences 
force of water movement is the transpiration pull energy of 
radiation root pressure to certain extent mainly in night irrigation 
and changes in flow sections of conductive pathways from roots 
leaves The speed of water conduct The speed of water 
depends on species ontogenetic stage on exterior conditions growing season 
in spring If physiological functions are in healthy state the 
movement in plant is continuous transpiration flow The speed of 
flow is expressed by an amount of water transported via 
part of conductive tissues in unit of time and its 
power depends on the area of cross section of conductive 
In lower nonvascular plants water only spreads by means of 
which reasons relatively small growth of these plants Water flow 
vascular plants is faster If the transpiration flow is maximal 
average speed of water flow through xylem of evergreen conifers 
per hour in deciduous scattered porose species such as birch 
lime it varies from to per hour and in an 
of oak this range is between per hour circular porose 
and up to per hour in lianas Release of water 
plants Especially leaves but also stems mainly young ones may 
studied as bodies saturated with water or humid areas that 
release water in the form of vapour into the air 
process of water evaporation from the surface of leaves and 
parts of plants into the atmosphere is called transpiration It 
driven by physical rules of vapour and physiological state of 
tissues Plants leaves can also release water in liquid state 
the process of gutation Guttation lot of plants are able 
exclude water in liquid state This way of water release 
known as guttation from Lat gutta drop plant presses water 
special pores hydathodes The cavity is filled in with thin 
parenchyma cells epithem that encloses vascular bundle bringing water The 
pressure is cofactor in guttation Guttation is not as frequent 
woody plants as in herbs It occurs when the air 
supersaturated with vapour after warm night or in early spring 
the morning when root pressure rises Guttation is not the 
as dropping of saccharide solutions from lime leaves attacked by 
Transpiration and its biological control Transpiration is loss of water 
plants by means of evaporation diffusion process It depends on 
conditions of vapour humidity temperature and movement of air water 
plant species and ontogenetic stage rhythm The rate of transpiration 
of water released by defined part of plant in unit 
time varies within an individual leaves in various positions radiation 
by kinds of plant surfaces Transpiration by stomata into the 
is called stomatal transpiration transpiration by cuticle is called cuticular 
and release through bark is known as peridermal rhytidomal or 
transpiration Fig Stomatal transpiration is easy to control for plant 
of stomata rises diffusion resistance of leaves up to times 
transpiration in which water overcomes the resistance of epidermis cells 
reach up to of the total transpiration in hygrophilous species 
conifers and only in succulents The peridermal transpiration from the 
of suberionized stems is comparable to the cuticular transpiration in 
it makes about of potential evaporation The cuticular transpiration in 
well developed leaves presents about of the stomatal transpiration The 
transpiration is affected by decreasing air humidity fall of air 
from to brings elevates the cuticular transpiration about times rising 
and pollution of air that endangers wax surfaces of leaves 
and nutrients are brought into living photosynthetising organs by means 
transpiration flow and it is again transpiration that cools these 
thus protecting them from overheating Woody plants that grow on 
sites have thicker cuticles small numerous stomata arranged in groups 
of quick reactions The rate of transpiration changes with age 
is more intense at first stages of organogenesis than in 
ones Injuries of plants typically enhance transpiration Cut off parts 
transpiration in the first minutes yet it later slows down 
result of closing of pores Stomata make epidermis partition with 
openings Water transpiration through this partition is always higher than 
transpiration from an open water level since molecules of vapour 
not squeezed perpendicularly above the surface They form fan shape 
diffusion of the molecules into the air lot of woody 
face an excessive transpiration by enlarging the border layer of 
over transpiring leaf surface and forming trichomes Quercus pubescens The 
of stomata in leaf present from to of the total 
area Fig The rate of transpiration through stomata is affected 
the size not by their number Opening of stomata immensely 
transpiration but once opened transpiration slows down Stefan rule of 
It is similar with closing of stomata rate of transpiration 
is not linear There is daily rhythm of opening stomata 
the majority of woody plants there are two transpiration daily 
with midday depression In lack of water stomata only open 
the morning The regulation is connected with change in turgor 
stomata cells Stomata are hydroactive and photoactive Water deficit affects 
more than light In lack of water they even close 
the light Permanent darkness elicits their opening high density of 
elicits closing as well as short wave rays Fig Stomata 
the lower epidermis of oak leaf Two guard cells can 
transpiration by increasing or decreasing the size of intercellular space 
them Cuticular transpiration is lower by dense cutin layer Environmental 
of transpiration Air humidity vapour pressure in the atmosphere Air 
plant may contain various percentages of vapour Even air that 
dry contains vapour The absolute content of vapour is expressed 
by the partial pressure or by weight units Nonetheless the 
of vapour in the air could not exceed the level 
maximal saturation maximal pressure of vapour as being in dynamic 
with water level of the same temperature It is not 
for the air surrounding plants to be fully saturated with 
which means it takes water in the phase of vapour 
plants containing various percentages of water The movement of water 
between plant surface and the air around plant is expressed 
rate of vapour pressure on the plant surface and in 
surrounding air Air humidity is commonly expressed as percentage relative 
humidity and is calculated from the absolute humidity and full 
air saturation with vapour expressed in this equation The equivalent 
air humidity rek means relative air humidity yet it does 
calculate with air temperature but studied plant temperature The equivalent 
air humidity is expressed in this equation rek et et 
faster the transpiration the lower the relative air humidity and 
higher the deficit of vapour When the relative air humidity 
very low transpiration almost stops because of closing of stomata 
rising temperature brings about rise in transpiration For instance vapour 
in the air at the temperature of is mm Hg 
Hg at and mm Hg at If the relative air 
is vapour pressure deficit in the above temperatures is mm 
and mm Hg respectively This fact reflects the progress of 
in the night influenced by the fall in temperatures Leaves 
photosynthetic organs absorb solar energy and are location of various 
processes that heat them up This results in an increased 
between vapour pressure in the saturated environment in leaf and 
its colder surroundings In particular plants with larger leaf surfaces 
darker colour can rise their temperatures faster which speeds up 
At the temperature of and the same level of radiation 
relative air humidity transpiration shall be times more intensive than 
the temperature of The light Light radiation affects transpiration both 
by heating leaves and other organs and indirectly as light 
an impulse for stomata to open which leads to higher 
transpiration Heating due to direct light radiation is more important 
plants that fall in vapour pressure in the atmosphere Transpiration 
down linearly with decreasing radiation intensity and falling temperature On 
contrary in case of an increased relative air humidity and 
light intensity transpiration rises The wind The wind affects transpiration 
removing vapour from the border layer of the atmosphere above 
leaf surface which may increase its water deficit The value 
water potential in leaves falls due to the wind which 
in disorder of formation of dry matter permanent air move 
about formation of xeromorph leaf structures Plants get lignified and 
holes get smaller The soil and other factors This group 
factors includes soil composition soil humidity and content of nutrients 
and gases in the soil As stated above not all 
contained in the soil is available to plants The most 
water capacity in the soil is of the full water 
in the soil in terms of water available to plant 
in more fertile soils is lower Even artificial fertilization can 
transpiration After taking nutrients up plant changes its osmotic colloid 
of the cell content Absorbed nutrients play part in the 
over the content of different forms of water in plant 
fertilization usually slows down transpiration temporarily but the subsequent growth 
the foliage area speeds transpiration up Phosphoric acid fertilizers decrease 
as potassium fertilizers do Calcium affects various plant species differently 
leading to rise other times to fall in transpiration The 
of transpiration is greatly affected by the temperature of the 
solution the content of oxygen and other gases in the 
that are secondary factors They either slow down or speed 
the uptake of water by roots which influence transpiration secondarily 
factors of transpiration include emission smoke gases and quakes Fly 
increase transpiration secondarily as it falls on leaf surface it 
about corrosion of the cuticle or grave dehydration of leaf 
thus increasing transpiration Quakes also bring about the increase in 
This means it is necessary to transport plants with proper 
Quantities of transpiration The greatest consumption of water for transpiration 
in late spring when woody species have developed foliage surface 
the majority of leaves have matured for photosynthesis Moreover this 
season of the quickest growth and longest daytime In central 
this season dates from May till late June depending on 
On sun shining day woody plants transpire of water per 
foliage area per an hour Conifers transpire only about of 
volume by deciduous trees beech forest ha transpires from to 
water daily and kg of water in growing season The 
capability rate between the amount of transpired water by plant 
the potential evaporation at the same place and time or 
transpiration and maximal transpiration average maximal speed of transpiration measured 
natural site are necessary quantities for the estimation of water 
by individuals of the same species at different sites The 
of water in litres or tons consumed for plant or 
transpiration in growing season per weight unit of dry matter 
is called transpiration coefficient or the inverse value efficiency of 
utilization known as transpiration efficiency Water turnover is period of 
exchange of water in plant by means of transpiration and 
of water plant uses only about of the total amount 
transpired water for the creation of dry matter The absolute 
of transpired water only serves as medium for nutrients and 
substances transported in plant body and as cooling system Anti 
substances decrease in transpiration means change in related physiological biochemical 
Anti transpiration substances help decrease transpiration of while leaf temperature 
of several degrees Anti transpiration substances also control the uptake 
transport of ions The main reason for the application of 
transpiration substances is to decrease transpiration at certain period thus 
plants from lack of water Yet it is not clear 
anti transpiration preparations do not limit the entry of carbon 
into leaf which would subsequently affect the photosynthesis Experience in 
application of various anti transpiration preparations shows that the application 
expensive and is not as efficient in numerous cases as 
expected The anti transpiration substances are recommended to be applied 
to transporting during transplanting in growing season as they improve 
success of transplanting Transpiration may be as well weakened by 
increased content of carbon dioxide in the air greenhouses or 
the application of some growth inhibition preparates abscisic acid
balance in plant We distinguish between an active and passive 
balance The active positive water balance is state when woody 
plays an active part in water saturation The passive negative 
balance means an increase in the water saturation deficit and 
in water management The optimal water balance is state when 
does not suffer either from lack or surplus of water 
that the activity of roots rate of flow and transpiration 
maximal As soon as the balance in the receipt conduct 
release of water by plant is disturbed greater water deficit 
about withering related with the accumulation of abscisic acid and 
in the content of gibberellins in leaves There are the 
stages of withering beginning temporary permanent irreversible The beginning stage 
withering occurs to woody plants in hot summer days when 
do not have enough capacity to store above ground parts 
such high amount of water that is transpired due to 
temperatures of the air Another problems may include the elimination 
conductive pathways due to entry of air from neighbouring tissues 
of air bubbles and embolisms or blocking of conductive pathways 
the growings from surrounding parenchyma cells thyllas Especially round porose 
species incline to thylas and embolizations Conductive pathways of woody 
may be made dysfunctional also by parasitic fungi or damaged 
phytofagous insects In the night there is decrease in air 
and lack of available water in soil so plant replaces 
lost water in the morning it is saturated with water 
appears fresh turgescent greater water deficit in plant results in 
in carbon dioxide uptake and limitation of photosynthesis due to 
of stomata In lack of available water in the soil 
in hypoxia lack of oxygen due to compression of flooding 
salting the beginning temporary withering usually passes into permanent irreversible 
which brings about deep and permanent damage that is reflected 
accumulation of toxically substances changes in growth and gradual dying 
nutrition of woody plants and the significance of nutrients Plant 
substances gained from the neighbourhood and assimilated substances in the 
is mineral in autotrophic species organic in heterotrophic and both 
and organic in mixotrophic species The nutrition is received by 
surfaces which are really extensive in plant bodies compared to 
volume In woody dry matter with no water there is 
of carbon of oxygen of hydrogen and of nitrogen Carbon 
taken in the form of gaseous from the atmosphere 
negligible amount in liquid stage taken up by roots from 
solution oxygen originates from and hydroxyl ion hydrogen 
from water molecules and nitrogen along with the remaining of 
substances from the soil Individual elements in fresh weight of 
are represented in the following rates
in to known as macroelements
in to microelements and traces As 
in ultramicroelements Ash elements are inorganic 
elements that remain from the dry matter of plant body 
burning Burning releases carbon and nitrogen from organic bonds both 
them in the form of oxides Most ashes are included 
bark and leaves of dry matter least of them is 
wood The above named mineral nutrients are also classified by 
rate of the necessity physiological effect and by the form 
are absorbed as cations anions or heavy metals The ones 
life significance are the nutrients without which plant is not 
to enclose its life cycle cannot give rise to germination 
and new healthy generation Moreover these elements are not replaceable 
any others These are biogenous elements with building or control 
catalysers cofactors moderators By the general significance and content they 
divided into macrobiogenous anions cations heavy metal
elements and elements in smaller or even trace 
called oligo biogenous elements
Qualitative requirements for the nutrition are more or less 
in all green plants They differ in quantitative requirements that 
reflect in different mutual rates While imbalanced nutrition mainly by 
biogenous elements hardly exists in natural conditions human activities by 
of single species and same age stands improper fertilizations and 
chemical preparations in winter emissions increase of and 
the atmosphere violate the nutrition both by biogenous and oligo 
elements The source of nutrition is mainly in the solid 
of soil that releases elements in the liquid phase to 
to roots by diffusion or mass flow rain water or 
Root exudates help make them more available hydrogen cations acid 
anions and organic acids Then individual nutrients enter roots via 
absorption exchange for excluded cations and anions and further on 
with the assistance of macromolecular protein transmitters So plant needs 
give out energy gained in respiration of root cells 
order to take in nutrients into roots This means that 
uptake of nutrients needed to satisfy the following needs satisfactory 
regime sufficient water and oxygen in soil photosynthates in roots 
become sources of energy in respiration Healthy nutrition of trees 
also influenced by the volume of soil utilizable by roots 
capabilities of an individual to form extend and maintain sufficient 
area surface of fine roots and root tips Another source 
nutrients is their recoverability in the fall of died plant 
leaves bark roots that are decomposed by soil organisms releasing 
nutrition for new usage The recoverability of nutrients is also 
by secretion and excretion of plant elements and to little 
also by washing away of easily mobile ions from leaves 
that are lower positioned in crown of tree can receive 
washed away from leaves positioned above them This makes little 
of nutrients by leaves Leaves secure the carbon nutrition control 
of quantity of plant production though they are able to 
even some ions and molecules through stomata or injured cuticle 
of potassium sulphates nitrites and nitrates saccharose nutrition else that 
roots that is successfully applied in intense agricultural fields and 
of fruit trees as leaf fertilization or on the other 
entry of toxic elements into plants through the barrier of 
tissues of stem system Though the main role in the 
plant nutrition is played by the root system not only 
the uptake of nutrients but also in the control of 
mobilization and separation into the above ground system Roles of 
nutrients The roles of individual nutrients can be briefly described 
follows carbon oxygen and hydrogen are the building stones of 
organic acids and lipids while carbon is almost only accepted 
leaves in the form of and hydrogen comes from 
taken in by roots Nitrogen joins these three elements during 
synthesis of amino acids some of which contain sulphur The 
is active from the soil in pH up to it 
root in the form of NO and its incorporation needs 
active participation of nitrate reductase and hydroxylamine reductase The intake 
the form of NH dominates from pH and it may 
toxic in alkaline environment it reduces intake of cations and 
causes the release of and Na from roots The incorporation 
this form into aminoacids causes release of and may lead 
rise in acidity of the cytoplasm This danger is serious 
in urban coniferous stands as result of high number of 
dog keepers Nitrogen may also be absorbed in oxides that 
in the atmosphere during electric discharges including combustion engines and 
are dissolved in rain water They could be absorbed by 
and roots higher nitrogen nutrition launches growth limits early maturation 
wood and makes woody plants more sensitive to parasitic fungi 
unstable temperatures especially low temperatures Phosphor is bound in nucleoproteins 
phospholipids It is essential in energy needs of metabolism phosphorilation 
saccharides energy containers of adenosine triphosphate adenosine diphosphate 
It is receipted as or The intake grows 
the presence of calcium cations and borates synergy see below 
transport and redistribution takes place in phloem sections of vascular 
Sulphur is absorbed in the form of sulphates and stimulates 
intake of nitrates Its way into the apoplast is passive 
it is transported into the symplast by specific permease built 
the cytoplasm membrane It is quite soon already in roots 
suplhur incroporates into specific proteins cystein and glutation constituents of 
antioxidation system Potassium enters plant as potassium univalent cation as 
exchange for hydrogen cation released into the rhizosphere by root 
It can activate about enzymes in the respiration process utilization 
energy reduction of nitrates protein syntheses and reserve saccharides It 
significant part in the hydratation of tissues and is released 
cells in stress Sodium Na is taken by plants in 
quantity than potassium it accumulates in vacuoles and acts as 
agent in halophytes plants growing in saline environment mangrove swamps 
the absolute majority of woody plants control water movement in 
by means of osmotically active saccharides or by means of 
simple organic substances proline proteins Calcium participates in 
hydration by stimulating the uptake of stabilizing membranes and eliminating 
permeability of these and by eliminating the release of ions 
can also activate certain enzymes control elongation as well as 
growth and it takes part in the preservation of good 
of cell environs through detoxication of organic acids considerably high 
of is contained by cell walls pectates while 
concentration in cell cytoplasm is very low Magnesium Mg is 
of middle lamellas in cell walls of chlorophyll molecules as 
atom of porphyrin complex and cooperates on the formation of 
in chloroplasts It activates Rubisco one of the most significant 
of photosynthesis and DNA polymerase enzyme It is part of 
proteins it controls water regime and phosphate transport Iron
transition to oligobiogenous elements it occurs in the form of 
chelate bonds it is essential for the synthesis of chlorophyll 
reduction oxidation processes in metabolism Boron is needed for the 
and transport of saccharides and phenols it plays part in 
elongation of pollen tubes and root cells and above all 
the synthesis of nucleic acids Moreover the presence of boron 
relation with the transport of phenolic substances decides over the 
of lignin and other defence structures Manganese in enzymes 
in the process of oxidation namely in respiration nitrates reductions 
of the rate of divalent and trivalent iron and in 
processes of photosynthesis Copper Cu stabilizes chlorphyll through the influence 
protein synthesis of chloroplastic structures it is constituent of enzymes 
affects nitrogen metabolism In the form of oxides and phenolases 
takes part in tissues lignification Molybdenum Mb is constituent of 
reductase and it supports the assimilation fixation of nitrogen required 
soil microorganisms Zinc has range of functions in the 
metabolism and hydrolytic reactions it affects the assimilation of saccharides 
of proteins and some growth elements Ion relations The ion 
is phenomenon in which parallel factors generate opposite effects In 
of mineral nutrition this means that one ion eliminates the 
of another ion into plant an increased concentration of and 
in the neighbourhood leads to limited uptake of
but also of phosphorus and sulphur There are more antagonistic 
between ions such as between magnesium and calcium phosphorus and 
sodium and calcium between forms of aluminium and iron and 
and iron Moreover the principle of synergism is applied in 
uptake of ions This means that two parallel factors have 
influence than if they were affecting individually For instance the 
intake of nitrogen or calcium stimulates the 
of potassium Potassium ions have positive effect on the phosphorus 
On the other hand the synergism may have negative affecting 
well Sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides if present along with 
ozone cause more serious damage to woody plants than if 
acted individually Besides the ion relations the nutrition intake also 
on the ion form in the soil from potassium sulphate 
is better accepted than from potassium chloride Nutrition changes 
be also caused by the competitiveness of ions that is 
in confusing ion needed for nutrition with another one of 
structure Such relation may be observed with potassium and rubidium 
They both share the same active binding centres of transmitting 
some centres are blocked by rubidium and cannot take needed 
of potassium In another case if significant respiration pathways are 
by an inhibitor root cells may lack energy for an 
distribution of needed nutrients through barriers of cell membranes Another 
aspect is plant capability of utilization of the absorbed nutrition 
build it in corresponding structure enzyme or translocate it 
places with higher demands and reutilize one ion On the 
hand plant needs to be capable of immobilizing nutrition absorbed 
surplus amount and detoxication of some toxic substances condensing of 
ions and formation of oxalate crystals or carbon calcid chelating 
heavy metals Nutrition disorders Nutrition disorders include not only 
nutrition by some elements differentiation but also surplus nutrition luxuriant 
imbalanced nutrition Trees react to nutrition disorders by changes in 
and its timing but if the disorders are more serious 
may lead to disease and visible damage to plant and 
changes colour of leaves changes in the development of certain 
are evaluated as deficiency disease For the adequate plant 
it is necessary that the intake of elements their transport 
in some elements due to immobility of these and utilization 
not disrupted Therefore the standard of mineral nutrition availability and 
of nutrients needs to be studied as whole from various 
This means to analyse it from the perspective of soil 
and its physical chemical characteristics and from the perspective of 
plant which is complex since the occurrence of substances amount 
substances form and mutual ratio of substances varies by structure 
ontogenetic stage season All these factors show that even fertilization 
which seems easy at first sight may be contra productive
