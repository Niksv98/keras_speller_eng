This Study Guide to the Science of Botany is textbook 
shelved at the biology bookshelf and intended to 
course of study in the subject of Botany utilizing articles 
in Wikipedia with links to other relevant web sites and 
as appropriate In some cases portions of the text 
Wikipedia articles have been used to materially develop introductory text 
the Guide For the new user it need be pointed 
that Wikipedia from standard encyclopedia in two important 
it is hypertext document and it is open and editable 
therefore constantly changing For the student following this or any 
through Wikipedia to cover speci subject it is recommended that 
article page be read in its entirety before any 
are followed to other topics or explanations It is too 
otherwise to simply become lost in maze of links and 
the main thrust of an article presented as an assignment 
the Guide Because Wikipedia is constantly changing and it is 
improving the quality of each article encountered will be variable 
articles are well written and go to adequate depth whereas 
lacking proponent are shallow and incomplete Short or sloppy looking 
may contain questionable facts These short comings should diminish with 
but can be problem for the student One clear advantage 
using this Guide linked to hypertext like Wikipedia is the 
redundancy with serendipity factor that arises when an article is 
and its hyperlinks followed this factor can be powerful learning 
The persistent reader is subjected to fairly high degree of 
reading often presenting slightly perspectives on the same 
topic with the result that learning comes from redundancy and 
concepts presented in more than one way At 
same time some hyperlinks lead down less relevant paths bringing 
and unanticipated knowledge If as student you are truly interested 
mastering the subject of botany you must be prepared to 
beyond the basic assignments in some cases beyond Wikipedia to 
other outside web sites It seems likely that the typical 
of the Study Guide to the Science of Botany is 
necessarily an active student taking course in botany at the 
school or college Botany 
biology bookshelf
level but person with strong interest in plants an amateur 
or gardener Therefore the guide must incorporate both the basic 
and physiological aspects of plants as well as extensive taxonomy 
coverage of the diversity of plants and related organisms The 
of material now available on the web covering the latter 
is becoming nothing short of phenomenal In ect one now 
access to much of the world plant diversity with photographs 
descriptions in many cases from web sites maintained by specialists 
goal of the guide is to provide systematics based approach 
capturing this kind of information hopefully giving the student strong 
in plant systematics The importance of this approach is not 
everyone should become taxonomist or become more familiar with plant 
specialized eld of botanical science with relatively narrow following but 
appreciation for and understanding of species diversity is most critical 
this time in our earth history marked by accelerated species 
and destruction of native ecosystems by both human population expansion 
man induced spread of non native species The Study Guide 
the Science of Botany includes two other parallel documents intended 
enhance the usefulness of the Guide These could also be 
separately or independently as source documents for beginning course in 
They are the Discussion pages and the Laboratory Exercise pages 
are explained in detail in the next Section titled How 
use this Guide Category Botany Chapter on page
Category Botany How to use Contents Page How 
Use the Botany Study Guide The purpose of the Study 
to the Science of Botany is to weave out of 
information on Life Science and especially Botany contained in Wikipedia 
of study for the student or layman It is anticipated 
this course will be either supplemental to instruction being received 
school or college or will be self directed In either 
the Guide is not novel and should not be approached 
one smooth ow of dialogue is simply not possible and 
not be anticipated The Guide may be closer to the 
disjointed notes generated by student from lecture or careful reading 
detailed textbook Within each subsection of Chapter introductory text is 
by one or more reading assignments of the form Read 
Links need not be pursued at this time Following that 
clicking on the link to Wikipedia Botany in this case 
open an article intended to provide the details of the 
subsection Recommended articles should be read from top to bottom 
then re read following some or all of the links 
in the article to other articles for expanded elucidation or 
clarify terms that is in most cases completion of an 
recommended article includes at least some or all articles linked 
the Obviously it cannot be the case that all 
are followed to articles whose links are then followed to 
and so on until no new material is encountered It 
likely there would be no quick end to such pursuit 
amount of time spent wandering beyond the original article is 
personal matter of how much the reader is getting out 
the foray than anything else Realize it is certainly possible 
wander well the subject at hand As in the example 
notes are provided with assignments giving some direction for pursuing 
An instruction NOT to follow links simply means the additional 
will be encountered later in the course of instruction and 
beyond the assigned article may provide too much detail for 
student The following example Read Science The following links are 
Scienti Method Philosophy of Science Botany
Science Scientific method
Philosophy of science How to use
two other links are part of the assignment Other links 
may be followed to expand your knowledge or as always 
aid in understanding of technical terms encountered Hyperlinks included with 
text in the Guide are there simply for convenience usually 
topics somewhat peripheral to the main one In all cases 
your way back to the Guide may become tricky but 
have to leave this up to you to establish beyond 
out that your browser Back button is intended for this 
Discussion Questions At the end of each subsection are posted 
to several questions In general you will get more out 
these questions if you write out your answer on piece 
paper You may wish to accomplish this on the re 
allowing each question to guide your quest for an answer 
page for each chapter provides answers to the questions posed 
the questions are intended to be thought provoking and may 
have single straight forward answer Answers on the discussion pages 
also necessarily much longer than would be expected of any 
student it is expected that each student answer will somewhere 
the broad discussion presented Laboratory Exercises natural sciences course laboratory 
is supposed to provide hands on experience in exploring topics 
in the text and lecture units The best that website 
give towards this goal is manual that is liberally provided 
pictures and diagrams The student must provide the hands on 
the neighboring natural world Fortunately in botany this is much 
to accomplish than in almost any other eld of science 
the outdoors the local market and if available botanical garden 
be sources of materials for study Indeed we may teach 
structure of pome using an apple in the hope that 
student will end up with pear In using any of 
Laboratory Exercises it is always best to read through the 
module before actually doing anything Resist the temptation to view 
material as an instruction manual to be followed in speci 
For one thing it is to write module 
covers at each step all that the student should know 
proceeding on to the next step The value of any 
will be signi cantly enhanced if you have pretty good 
where it is going in advance General Navigation The Study 
is divided into Sections and Chapters which the 
material of each module At the bottom of each text

Introduction to Botany Botany as Science Botany is the branch 
biology concerned with the scienti study of plants Traditionally botanists 
all organisms that were not generally regarded as animal However 
in our knowledge about the myriad forms of life especially 
viruses and bacteria have led to spinning from Botany the 
called Microbiology Chapter on page

Category Botany Detailed 
Chapter on page How to use Still the microbes are 
covered in introductory Botany courses although their status as neither 
nor plant is rmly established Plants are living entities and 
presented within Biology will have relevance here most particularly at 
cellular and subcellular levels of organization Chapter Both plants and 
deal with the same problems of maintaining life on planet 
their approaches seem quite but the end result 
the same continued existence in an organized state as part 
universe whose tendency is towards greater disorganization Back on Earth 
it is fact that microbes plants and animals comprise very 
system We divide them apart because our minds work best 
way We categorize and learn common features or properties of 
categories This approach is neither right nor wrong but is 
cient for our minds Nonetheless it is desirable to regularly 
back and realize that the boundaries between categories are often 
constructs and exceptions to our categories usually abound It was 
to in the opening that Botany is science 
what makes Botany or anything else science It is important 
acquire grasp of the fundamentals of science itself to fully 
both how botanical knowledge was gained as well as how 
can be used It is usually quickly disinteresting to acquire 
simply for the sake of knowing Humans do not just 
mountains because they are there they climb them because they 
there Living Systems Biology is as the study 
life and Botany is that discipline within Biology concerned with 
study of living organisms called plants and with certain other 
things that are not plants but are not animals either 
ning Plant Like many words in common usage that apply 
biological entities or concepts the term plant is more
to than might be at obvious Although 
describe Kingdom Plantae the boundaries members of Plantae 
more inclusive than our common concept of plant We are 
to regard plant as meaning multicellular eukaryotic organism that generally 
not have sensory organs or voluntary motion and has when 
root stem and leaves However botanically only vascular plants have 
stem and leaves and even some vascular plants such as 
carnivorous plants and duckweed fall afoul of that 
to be fair the vascular plants are the plants we 
to encounter every day and that most people would readily 
as plants more signi cant point of departure between Plantae 
plants occurs among the seaweeds Technically only relatively minor group 
seaweeds the chlorophytes or green algae are members of the 
Plantae The majority of seaweeds like the kelps very large 
algae from the Order Laminariales despite super cial appearance of 
lack true stems leaves roots and any kind of vascular 
as found in higher plants Thus the kelps are not 
but are they plants Certainly if we regard the green 
Plants and their Uses as plants it is
exclude the more prominent red and brown algae of our 
waters Another much broader for plant is that 
refers to any organism that is photoautotrophic produces its own 
from raw inorganic materials and sunlight This is not an 
de nition and is one that focuses on the role 
typically play in an ecosystem However there are photoautotrophs among 
Prokaryotes speci cally photoautotrophic bacteria and cyanophytes The latter are 
called for good reasons blue green algae Then there arises 
problem that many people would consider that mushroom is plant 
is the fruiting body of fungus Kingdom Fungi and not 
at all but saprophytic However there are more than few 
of owering plants fungi and bacteria that are not autotrophic 
parasitic We cannot hope to er rm answer The list 
characteristics that separate the Plantae from the other biological kingdoms 
at least technical but realize it is only 
de nition The problem this lack of precision or agreement 
the of plant presents is one of understanding 
often encountered in Wikipedia and other articles of the sort 
is one of the two transport tissues of plants In 
it cannot be assumed this means all plants algae through 
plants It very probably does not include fungi or bacteria 
it is usually safest to assume the discussion is about 
plants essentially the ferns conifers owering plants and few others

The distinction between life and non life is not as 
made as you might think There exist intracellular parasites that 
progressively less alive in terms of being metabolically active Plants 
their Uses There can be no disputing the fundamental signi 
of plants to the ecology of our planet Photosynthetic plants 
energy arriving from the sun to create complex organic molecules 
inorganic substances and by this process contribute oxygen to the 
Advanced animal life is very much dependent upon this source 
oxygen as well as the organic molecules that form the 
of nearly every food web on the planet However humans 
plants in many ways especially as sources of pleasure food 
material for shelter clothing and more Consider here the role 
play in our everyday lives and in our economy Introduction 
Plant Classi cation At the beginning of this chapter it 
suggested that each of us categorizes information we encounter on 
basis Our minds seem to want to nd relationships between 
and How to use observations to erect mental bins in 
to place new items with previous facts This natural human 
is the basis for prejudice in as much as facts 
together can become strongly associated But these are personal constructs 
order for scientists of many races speaking many languages and 
from all manner of backgrounds and experiences to work productively 
to solve common problems the objects with which they work 
be classi ed within universally accepted framework The classi cation 
living things is called systematics or taxonomy and ideally should 
ect the evolutionary history phylogeny of the organisms 
arranges organisms in groups called taxa while systematics seeks clues 
their relationships The dominant system of Scienti Classi cation is 
Linnaean taxonomy and includes classi cation ranks as well as 
organism naming convention called binomial nomenclature Traditionally all living things 
divided into ve kingdoms Monera Protista Fungi Plantae Animalia However 
ve kingdom system has been replaced by Carl Woese three 
system which focuses on phylogenic roots and comparison of DNA 
The older approach utilized visual observation as the basis of 
cation The three domains re ect whether cells have nuclei 
or not prokaryotic as well as in cell 
and cell walls Archaea Eubacteria Eukaryota Recall and review as 
how these groupings relate to the sequence of events in 
evolutionary history of life as summarized in Timeline of Evolution 
will return to the subject of Scienti Classi cation to 
in much more detail the groups of organisms studied in 
beginning with Chapter First however we shall turn our attention 
the structure and function of cells and eventually to gain 
understanding of plant structure plant anatomy and function plant physiology 
Terminology In Section of this text we will delve 
deeper into plant systematics But you should be aware of 
general terms related to classi catory schemes that are used 
in discussing plants You have probably encountered these terms many 
although may not be aware of their exact
example much of the material in Section of this textbook 
biased towards owering plants That is much of the descriptive 
here as well as at Wikipedia refers speci cally to 
Flowering plants are Monera

Plantae Eubacteria Eukaryota
Timeline of evolution See Also angiosperms plants that have 
and produce seeds and comprise the majority of the plants 
would normally encounter in say nursery if not on the 
eld or empty lot Seed bearing plants include both the 
and the gymnosperms the latter now treated as modern group 
conifers The conifers are also common plants especially in higher 
but bear cones instead of owers Both conifers and owering 
develop vascular tissues internally that conduct uids especially water throughout 
plant Included in the vascular plants are ferns Ferns have 
tissue but reproduce by spores They do not produce seeds 
do not bear owers See Also Discussion of this chapter

structure and function in an organism Biologists recognize two basic 
of cells prokaryotic and eukaryotic Prokaryotic cells are structurally more 
They are found only in single celled and some simple 
organisms all bacteria and some algae which all belong to

these two cell types are critical to how an organism

to list the processes or outcomes that cells must

cell structure as our interest must eventually focus on plants

Introduction Chapter Plant Tissues Introduction Plant Tissues Most plant cells 
specialized to greater or lesser degree and arranged together in 
plant tissue can be simple or complex depending upon whether 
is composed of one or more than one type of 
The simplest tissue found in plants is called parenchyma The 
are not very specialized more or less rounded or angular 
packed together and thin walled type of parenchyma called chlorenchyma 
the cells contain chloroplasts forms tissue usually in the leaves 
for most of the photosynthesis occurring in the plant Note 
in simple tissues at least tissues comprised mostly of one 
type the tissue name follows from the cell type However 
may also have unique anatomical names related to where in 
plant they occur Meristems The growth of plant requires source 
cells located in places where growth is needed 
can be initiated to further the body plan in comparison 
animals plants are rather open in this regard Some enlargement 
size is always possible by elongation or enlargement of existing 
or by existing cells simply dividing But differentiation of one 
type into another is only possible if the initial cell 
cell is not very specialized Tissues comprised of cells that 
undiferentiated and supply by their divisions cells to form 
tissues and organs are called meristems Meristem tissue occurs in 
that allow for very orderly pattern of growth

previous chapter most plant cells are specialized to greater or 
degree and arranged together in tissues tissue can be simple 
complex depending upon whether it is composed of one or 
than one type of cell Tissues are further arranged or 
into organs that carry out life functions of the organism 
organs include the leaf stem root and reproductive structures The 
three are sometimes called the vegetative organs and are the 
of exploration in this chapter Reproductive organs will be covered 
Chapter The relationships of the organs within plant body to 
other remains an unsettled subject within plant morphology The fundamental 
is whether these are truly structures or just 
cations of one basic structure

Leaf The plant body is an integrated functional unit so 
division of plant into organs is largely conceptual providing convenient

leaf must also be balanced against the fact that most 
the loss of water plant might su er is going

plants carry out the same very basic functions there is
